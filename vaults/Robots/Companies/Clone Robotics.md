Synthetic human
- Skeletal system: 206 bones like in humans
	- Doesn't replicate bone marrow and calcium
- Muscular system: 1000+ [[Myofiber artificial muscles]]
	- Humans have about 639 skeletal muscles so this is more
	- 1 kg force per 3 grams
- Power source
	- Human - ATP
	- Protoclone - 500W hydraulic pump
- Force efficiency
	- Human - 15:1
	- Protoclone - 333:1
- Nervous System
	- Human - 86 billion neurons, central & peripheral systems, talk by neurotransmitters and hormones
	- Protoclone
		- 4 depth cameras for vision
		- 70 inertial sensors for joint positioning
		- 320 pressure sensors
	- So far human neurons relatively self-learn and self-heal, Clone can't do that yet
- Circulatory System
	- Human - dual-circuit (pulmonary/systemic), 5-6 liters total blood, 70 ml/kg/min output
		- For movement and nutrients (power)
	- Protoclone - single-circuit, hydraulic, with 500W electric "heart", 40 L/min fluid flow rate
		- Only for movement
- Temperature regulation
	- Human - sweating/shivering
	- Protoclone - evaporative cooling, needs water refill every 8 hours (needs to drink huh)
- Skin
	- Human - cl
- Systems clone doesn't have (as of now)
	- Digestive
	- Endocrine
	- Immune (this would make it self healing)
