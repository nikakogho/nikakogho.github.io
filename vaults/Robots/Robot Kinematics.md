[[Configuration]] - state of all joints (angle, length, etc)

[[Degrees of Freedom]] is an important concept

[[Forward Kinematics]] to know where end-effector will go for given configuration, each step applied as [[Homogenous Transform]]

[[Inverse Kinematics]] to find configuration to get to target state of end-effector

**Velocity ellipsoid** gives space of possible velocities in given configuration

**Singularity** - configuration where robot loses ability to move in a certain direction
