Usually sensing surroundings (often by [[LiDaR]]) and then computing what objects are around and comparing that to map accumulated so far to determine where we are

Many possible implementations, one way by doing Graph SLAM explained [here](https://medium.com/machinevision/implement-slam-from-scratch-b1fb599f40c8)
