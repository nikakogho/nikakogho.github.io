DOF = 3 * (N - 1 - J) + sum of total joint DOF
DOF = 3 * (N - 1) - 2J<sub>1</sub> - J<sub>2</sub>

## Example 1
Here J = 8R + 9P + overlapping 10R = 27
J<sub>1</sub> = 27
Links are N = 20 links + ground = 21

DOF = 3 * (N - 1) - 2 J<sub>1</sub> = 60 - 54 = 6

## Example 2
J = 4P + 2R = 6 = J<sub>1</sub>
N = 4 legs + 1 square + 1 ground = 6

DOF = 3 * (N - 1) - 2 J<sub>1</sub> = 3
