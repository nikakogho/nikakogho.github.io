## Types
- [[Legged Locomotion]] ([[Walking]] or [[Running]])
- [[Wheeled Locomotion]] (never in nature but often in robots)
- Tracks like on tanks
- Rolling (sometimes in nature too like with Armadillo)
- Sliding/slithering like with [[Snake Robot]]

## Energy Efficiency by Type
1. Railway wheels
2. Walking
3. Tires on soft ground
4. Running
5. Crawling/sliding/slithering

## Central Pattern Generator
Like in biology, here too it is a rhythmic sequence of moves. Can be adjusted for specific case with extra signals
