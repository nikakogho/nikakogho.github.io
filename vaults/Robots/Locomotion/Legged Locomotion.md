[[Walking]] or [[Running]].
[[Locomotion (Movement)]] with legs.

Parts:

* Computing reference trajectory
* Computing **gait** (right type of oscillation for movement)
  * Made of **leg events**

## Leg Events

Motion for leg. Together making up oscillation for gait.

Number of possible leg events for legged locomotion is
N = (2k - 1)! where k = number of legs

> k = 1 then N = 1
> k = 2 then N = 6
> k = 3 then N = 120
> k = 4 then N = 5040
> k = 5 then N = 362 880
> k = 6 then N = 39 916 800

If each leg can move up (U), down (D), or not at all (-) then for two legs possibilities are

## [[Balance]]

To not fall. Can be static or dynamic.

## Gait

Oscillating pattern of moving.
