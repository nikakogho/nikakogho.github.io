2 spaces are topologically equivalent if one can be deformed into another without cutting/gluing

Topologically equivalent:
- sphere and football
- donut and mug of coffee

Topologically not equivalent:
- surface of sphere and plane

## Topologically distinct 1D
A line: represented as R<sup>1</sup>, 1 number to say x coordinate.

A circle: represented as S<sup>1</sup> to say its angle

A closed interval of line as start and end points a, b âŠ‚ R<sup>1</sup>

Note: open interval of line doesn't include endpoints so is topologically equal to a line

## Higher dimensions
n-D Euclidean space is R<sup>n</sup> and n-D surface of (n+1)-D sphere is S<sup>n</sup>
