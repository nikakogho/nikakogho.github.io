## Functions

* **Pressure Garment** for pressure maintenance
* Oxygen supply and CO<sub>2</sub> removal
* Temperature regulation
* Mobility
* Communications

## Layers

* Outer layer - made from materials like \[\[Gore-Tex]] to protect from abrasion and let moisture escape
* Pressure Garment - keep pressure
* Insulation Layers - reflect solar temperature, retain body heat
* Liquid Cooling and Ventilation Garment (LCVG) - worn typically directly on naked skin
  * Water tubes for cooling
  * Ventilation - lets sweat escape

## Types

* Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU) - for spacewalks
  * Orlan suit - for Russian spacecraft
  * Axiom Extravehicular Mobility Unit (AxEMU) - for moon exploration
  * SpaceX EVA suit - builds on IVA suit
* Advanced Crew Escape Suit (ACES) - for launch and re-entry, lighter and less bulky
* Intravehicular Activity (IVA) Suits - more comfort

## Materials used

* Kevlar - knees and elbows for protection to abrasion
* Neoprene - in gloves and seals for flexibility in cold and resistance to chemicals
* Mylar - thermal insulation
* Nomex - fire resistant in inner layers for emergency
* Aluminum - frame structural support
