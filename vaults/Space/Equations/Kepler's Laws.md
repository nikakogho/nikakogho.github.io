1. Orbits are in shape of ellipse with one body (like sun) as one focus point
2. In same time a celestial body covers same are in its orbit
3. Period of one cycle P is related to length of semi-major axis M such that P<sup>2</sup>/M<sup>3</sup> is constant: in better terms, for objects with masses m<sub>1</sub> and m<sub>2</sub> and period P with semi major axis a, we get that (m<sub>1</sub> + m<sub>2</sub>) \* P<sup>2</sup> is proportional to a<sup>3</sup>. When masses don’t change much (like sun and sun’s planets, sun’s mass is far more relevant) it is simplified to P<sup>2</sup> being proportional to a<sup>3</sup>
