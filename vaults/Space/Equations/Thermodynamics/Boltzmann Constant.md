k<sub>B</sub> = PV / NT
kB = R / N<sub>A</sub>

P - pressure
V - volume
N - number of molecules
T - temperature

R - ideal gas constant
N<sub>A</sub> - Avogadro's number = 6.022 \* 10<sup>23</sup> mol<sup>-1</sup>

Which speed has what rate of occurrence

f(v) - probability density at speed *v* (probability per unit speed of finding a molecule at speed roughly *v*)
T - temperature
k - Boltzmann constant

Area of graph (number of molecules) is same for a gas at all temperatures so colder means taller and hotter means shorter
