Specific impulse = I<sub>sp</sub>
Higher specific impulse means better rocket, means longer flight range

## Definition by weight flow rate
I<sub>sp</sub> = Thrust / weight flow rate (measured in seconds)
I<sub>sp</sub> = v<sub>propellant</sub> / g
weight flow rate = mass flow rate * g

v<sub>propellant</sub> = C

### Exhaust Velocity
C = I<sub>sp</sub> * g = Thrust / mass flow rate

### Specific Propellant Consumption
Total mass consumed / total impulse delivered

mass flow rate = how many kg gets ejected per second
mass flow rate (m/t) = œÅ * A * v

**Mass flow rate is constant**

Higher I<sub>sp</sub> means less fuel to rocket mass ratio needed to get to space

Mass = m<sub>structure</sub> + m<sub>payload</sub> + m<sub>propellant</sub>

structure and payload don't change so change in mass = change in propellant

## Definition by mass flow rate
I<sub>sp</sub> = Thrust / weight mass rate (measured in m/s)
