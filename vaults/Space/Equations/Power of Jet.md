P<sub>jet</sub> = mass flow rate \* v<sup>2</sup> / 2 = F \* v<sub>exit</sub> / 2 = weight flow rate \* g<sub>0</sub> \* I<sub>sp</sub><sup>2</sup> / 2 = F \* g<sub>0</sub> \* I<sub>sp</sub> / 2

Specific power = P<sub>jet</sub> / m<sub>initial</sub>

Electric rockets have less specific power than chemical

For chemical propellants maximum power available is
P<sub>chem</sub> = mass flow rate \* Q<sub>R</sub> \* J

Kinetic energy per unit flow of mass = c<sup>2</sup> / 2

J = units conversion constant

Sometimes we choose low energy efficiency on purpose in order to choose high mass efficiency, such as with nuclear propelled rockets and sometimes solar as in those we have unlimited heat but limited propellant

## Combustion Efficiency

![Pasted_image_20241011173133.png](pasted_image_20241011173133.png) = actual energy released / ideal case
High for chemical rocket (94-99%)
Low for electric
For solar cells it is 10-30%

## Power Transmitted

Power transmitted at one instant of time is
P<sub>vehicle</sub> = F \* u
u - vehicle velocity

## Internal Efficiency

kinetic energy / available chemical energy = kinetic energy / (stored chemical energy \* combustion efficiency)

kinetic energy per unit mass / available energy content of propellant
1/2 \* c<sup>2</sup> / q

## Propulsive Efficiency

How much of vehicle power is actually used (not lost to friction).

Power used = F \* u
Exhaust power = 1/2 \* mass flow rate \* (c - u)<sup>2</sup> = (2u/c) / (1 + (u/c)<sup>2</sup>)

Propulsive Efficiency = Useful Power / Total Power

Total Power = Useful Power + Exhaust Power
Total Power = P<sub>chem</sub> \* combustion efficiency

Propulsive Efficiency = 1 when c = u => ejected gas stands still in space

## Specific  Propellant Consumption

SPC = mass flow rate / thrust
