Measures [[Volume Flow Rate|fluid flow velocity]] by measuring pressure difference between stagnation and static pressures

**Stagnation pressure** - pressure when speed = 0 (not flowing at this location)

**Static pressure** - pressure that fluid exerts on an object when itâ€™s at rest relative to it

Stagnation = total =  static + dynamic
