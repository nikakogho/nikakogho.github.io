Can use VHF (137-148 MHz), UHF (400-470 MHz), S-Band (2-2.4 GHz) or X-Band (8-8.4 GHz)
Ground station will have to send and receive in same frequency
Higher frequency can be more distorted by noise like weather but we will need it for high resolution imaging

### VHF
- Basic beacon signals and simple commands
- Downlink speed mostly 1.2-9.6 kbps, sometimes 19.2 kbps, max 38.4 kbps
- Uplink of 1.2-2.4 kbps

### UHF
- Telemetry, tracking & command, sometimes mission data
- Downlink of 9.6-38.4 kbps, best case 100-250 kbps
- Uplink of 1.2-9.6 kbps

### S-Band
- Main mission data download like Earth images or other
- Downlink from 100 kbps to 1-2 Mbps. Possible to get 4-10 Mbps
- Uplink max 1 Mbps if ground station power and other factors allow

### X-Band
- For high resolution imaging
- Downlink of 10-100 Mbps
	- Advanced CubeSats (6U+) with good ground station might push to 200-500 Mbps
- Uplink mostly not used in this range, overkill. Would be multiple Mbps if used
