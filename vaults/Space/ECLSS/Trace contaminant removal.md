## Spacecraft Maximum Allowable Concentrations (SMACs)
- exposure duration
- toxicity
    - non-cancerous with acceptable effects like mild headache
    - non-cancerous with unacceptable long-term effects like loss of consciousness or vision impairment
    - cancerous

## Physical
- dust
- food crumbs

Filtrations like vacuum cleaners
Eventually get clogged up, must be cleaned and replaced

## Chemical
all materials checked for **outgassing** - release of gass from material

### Removal by activated charcoal
- normal, for [[Space Suits]], removes mid-high molar weight organic vapors
- with Ambient Temperature Catalytic Oxidation (ATCO) (used in [[Space Shuttle]]) - removes CO and H<sub>2</sub>
- with High Temperature Catalytic Oxidation (HTCO) (used on [[International Space Station]]) - removes most hydrocarbons

## Smoke
Smoke sensors, gas masks
