“Grey water”:

* exhaled breath
* sweat
* hygiene water for washing

Grey water was first to be recycled
Then urine recycling was added

## Urine recycling

Urine contains urea, salt, and 65 other things
urea -> ammonia + CO<sub>2</sub>

[[International Space Station]] Urine Processor turns urine into water + brine (highly concentrated waste)

## Gas-liquid separation

On earth, bubbles form, go up, and boil away
In 0 gravity, bubbles form and get big but don’t come up and clog the process
Centrifuge used to solve: heavy water goes outside and can be removed while gas bubbles stay near center

## Russian way

Russian part of ISS uses diffusion instead such that water is diffused away from urine and is used in electrolyses to make oxygen, not reused as drinking water

## Hardware

**Equivalent mass** = mass of system + additional mass needed on solar panels to power this + additional mass needed in thermal pipes for regulating heat on this device

* top-left = ventillation
* bottomest left = distillation assembly
* above it = urine pretreatment and storage
* above it = recycle filter
* big tank in middle = waste water storage
* top-right = particulate filter
* below waste water storage = multi-filtration beds
* below particulate filter = volatile removal
* bottom-right = water storage tank
* left to it = water delivery tank. Adding iodine or silver as antibacterial here as from here it goes for drinking or electrolysis

* Urine system = pretreatment and storage -> distillation assembly -> recycle filter -> waste water storage
* Water system = waste water storage -> particulate dilter -> multi-filtration beds -> volatile removal -> water storage tank -> water delivery tank
