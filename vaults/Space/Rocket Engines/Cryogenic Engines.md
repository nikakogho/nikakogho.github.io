Liquid hydrogen, liquid oxygen and other propellant often need to be kept at very low temperatures like under -200 degrees C

Cryogenic engines do that

Mostly used in second and third stage
Used by \[\[Space Shuttle]], \[\[Falcon 9]], \[\[Saturn V]] and others

Achieved by USA, Russia, India, China, Japan, and France
Hard to make because

* High level of thermal insulation needed as different parts need very different temperatures ![Pasted\_image\_20241118022941.png](pasted_image_20241118022941.png)
* Oxidizer/Fuel ratio must be controlled, which is hard with so many inter-dependent turbopumps and systems
* Hydrogen diffuses in metal cracks - special metal alloys like Austenitic Stainless Steel had to be made to fix this

Hydrogen is liquified through a process by compressors, condensers, and throttling devices to bring temperature down to -253 degrees C

Liquid H<sub>2</sub> then stored near launch station and loaded right before launch

Fuel and oxidizer tanks are typically covered by outer tank made of aluminum-lithium alloy

Then polyurethane applied by spraying, protects outer tank from heat

## Design

* Pump - propellant stored at low pressure so a pump increases pressure brings LOX and LH2 into engine
  * Often driven by fast turbine (tens of thousands of RPM (revolutions per minute)) to increase pressure ![Pasted\_image\_20241118020832.png](pasted_image_20241118020832.png)
  * Cavitation: vapor bubbles must be prevented or it will damage pump and reduce efficiency
  * Mostly centrifugal (rotate around), sometimes axial (move in straight line)
  * Electric pump would need battery => more weight => not used
* LH<sub>2</sub> is circulated through engine to cool parts to prevent thermal shock and also to slightly warm LH<sub>2</sub> before ignition
  * Regenerative cooling - circulating LH<sub>2</sub> absorbs heat from pipes and walls, preventing rocket from overheating
  * Avoids direct vaporization, helps for consistent supply
  * Powers some pumps by pushing on them
  * Prevents ice formation
  * Often include venting to prevent pressure buildup
  * Part of it burned in pre-burners to drive turbopumps to prepare main engine
  * Expander Cycle - name for circulation, ensures that all propellant is used
    * Closed - all heated propellant goes through turbine and then engine
      * Most efficiency
    * Open/Bleed - some heated propellant is bled off or vented overboard
      * Less efficiency
      * More thrust
    * Dual - separate turbines for fuel and oxidizer
  * Gas Generator Cycle - a combustion chamber around turbine where some LH<sub>2</sub> is burned to drive turbine
    * Some exhaust energy is lost this way => not fully efficient
    * Used in SpaceX's \[\[Falcon 9]]'s \[\[Merlin Engine]] ![Pasted\_image\_20241118021856.png](pasted_image_20241118021856.png)
    * **Stages Combustion Cycle** - made more efficient by moving exhaust back into main combustion chamber along with small amount of oxygen to partially burn hydrogen to increase its temperature and pressure
      * Highest thrust and specific impulse
      * Very high pressure => needs very powerful and expensive parts ![Pasted\_image\_20241118022238.png](pasted_image_20241118022238.png)
* **Injector Plate** mixes fuel and oxidizer by atomizing them and then igniting them ![Pasted\_image\_20241118022611.png](pasted_image_20241118022611.png) ![Pasted\_image\_20241118022657.png](pasted_image_20241118022657.png)
