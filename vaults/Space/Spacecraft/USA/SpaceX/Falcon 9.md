2 stages
Thrust 7607 kN at sea level
![IMG\_2882.jpeg](img_2882.jpeg)

Can carry max 22 800 kg to low earth orbit and supports crewed missions with [[Crew Dragon]] or payload with Cargo Dragon

Equipped with Inertian Navigation System (INS) and GPS

## Structure

Assembled horizontally and then rolled out and rotated upward like [[Soyuz]].
**Fixed service structure** allows access to rocket with its elevator.
Connects to rocket with **Crew Access Arm**

## First Stage

9 [[Merlin Engine|Merlin engines]]
Reusable
8 cold has thrusters
4 landing legs

## Second Stage

1 Merlin vacuum engine optimized for space
Not reusable

## Cargo Dragon

Currently only reusable orbital cargo spacecraft.
Can carry up to 6 tons of payload between its pressurized and unpressurized sections.
Trunk has solar panels.
Has autonomous docking with [[International Space Station]]

## Launch

1. First stage (booster) engines ignite
2. 1:10 after reached supersonic speed
3. 2:38 first main engines shut down, first stage removed
4. [[Cold gas thruster]] helps booster fall back into earth
5. Second stage ignites
6. Dragonâ€™s protective surface removed
7. Usually after 8-10 minutes second stage removed
8. Dragon usually gets to ISS and [[Docking|docks]]

## Booster return

0. Detached from spacecraft and brough back toward earth by cold gas thrusters
1. Maneuvers to land back using 8 cold gas thrusters, grid fins and re-ignitable engines
2. Re-entry burns begin
3. First burn orients rocket to landing location
4. Second burn from 1300m/s to 250m/s
5. Third burn slows to 2m/s for soft landing
