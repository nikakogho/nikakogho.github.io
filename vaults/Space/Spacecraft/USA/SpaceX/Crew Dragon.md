and solar panel (blue) on other side (Dragon 1 had solar panels that unfold in space but this way is less risk).
Detaches 1 hour before splashdown.
No heat shield, burns up in atmosphere

## Attaching to ISS

By berthing or docking

### Berthing

When near enough, robotic arm of [[International Space Station]] captures it

## Docking with ISS

Approaches at these waypoints

And then slowly (few cm/s) approaches and does soft capture then hard capture
