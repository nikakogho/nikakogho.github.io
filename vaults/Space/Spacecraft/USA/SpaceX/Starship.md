## Super Heavy booster

71 meters tall.
33 [[Raptor Engine|Raptor engines]], 13 in center and 20 on sides.
2400 tons of LOX
700 tons of liquid methane

Vented interstage allows hot staging (second stage starts before first is detached)

### Booster catch with chopsticks

On 5th test flight in October 13, 2024

## Starship spacecraft

50.3 meters tall
Will hold 100 people (current world record 8 people)
Empty mass 100 tons
Gross mass 1300 tons
6 Raptor engines: 3 optimized for space and 3 for atmosphere
Can carry 100-150 tons to Low Earth Orbit
Up to 27 tons to Geostationary Transfer Orbit
Fully reusable
Planned to be refueled by tanker variants of Starship (almost same ship just without windows)
Uses body flaps for control in atmosphere

### Types

* Crew starship: 100 people
* Cargo starship: 1000 cubic meters cargo
* Tanker starship: for on-orbit refueling
* One-way Starship (not planned yet) - for one time injecting cargo into space
* Lunar Starship - for moon missions like Artemis (no heatshield or large flaps as no re-entry in atmosphere)
* Earth transport - point-to-point travel on earth

## Assembly

Happens at [[Starbase]]

## Belly-flop maneuver

During re-entry the starship rotates to be falling on “belly” to expose more surface and slow down faster, then “stands up” again in time to land

## Test flights

1. 20 April 2023
   * Goal: go up
   * Result: went up, exploded

2. 18 Nov 2023
   * Goal: hot staging + near-orbital trajectory + reentry
   * Result: hot staging worked but then exploded

3. 14 March 2024
   * Goal: orbital velocity + in-space engine relight + payload deployment test + reentry + splashdown
   * Result: Reached orbital velocity but exploded in reentry
