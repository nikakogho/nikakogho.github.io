67 propulsion systems
3 main engines [[RS-25 Engine]]
2 orbital maneuvering engines
38 reaction control primary thrusters
6 reaction control Vernier thrusters
2 large segmented booster solid propellant motors
16 stage separation rocket motors

First mission was to rescue a satellite that was wrongly put too low and to give it a new second stage in space

## Main Parts

* 3 liquid fuel engines at the bottom of the shuttle
* 2 SRBs on sides, 45 meters long with 13 000 kN thrust
* External Tank 47 meters tall and 33 500 kg that held liquid fuel for 3 main engines and also gave structural support
  * smaller liquid oxygen tank at top, pushing center of gravity up
  * intertank, load bearing structure between these tanks
  * larget liquid hydrogen tank at lower section

## Flight Steps

0. liquid hydrogen recirculation connnection: cryogenic fluid is circulized through valves, [[Feed Line|feed lines]] and turbopumps to regulate temperature
1. sparkler-like igniters blown below engines to get rid of stray hydrogen
2. 3 liquid fuel engines power up, tilt the axis of whole thing, held down by 8 [[Explosive Bolts]]
3. signal is sent that we are ready for next part
4. solid rocket boosters fire up, rocket goes up
5. when up 45km, SRBs are removed, start falling, and eventually unleash parachutes
6. Shuttle reaches orbit
7. ET used up, detaches and gets destroyed

## Landing Steps

1. Deorbit burn
   * Initiation: engines fired opposite to travel direction to slow down and decrease periapsis
   * Trajectory adjustment
2. Reentry
   1. Entering atmosphere at Mach 25, heat shield protects
   2. [[Reaction Control System|Reaction Control Systems (RCS)]] thrusters control attitude and stabilize direction
3. Descent
   1. Once slowed down to Mach 3, uses aerodynamic surfaces (ailerons and elevons) to control speed and trajectory
   2. S-Turns to reduce speed and altitude
4. Approaches runway at -20 degrees, steeper than commercial airlines
5. Landing gear deployed 10 seconds before touching runway
6. Final flare maneuver reduces descent rate
7. Touchdown at 160-240km/h
8. Wheel brakes and drag chutes
9. Post-landing operations like shutdown sequence and inspection
