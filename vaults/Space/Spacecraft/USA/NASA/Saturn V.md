### Service Module

Engine to enter/leave orbit and fuel electrical parts

### Command Module

Where the 3 astronauts are
Launch escape system at top to let astronauts escape in emergency

### Lunar Module

Lands on moon
7 meters tall
4 legs, all with a sensor of “close enough” to turn off engine, one leg has ladder and american flag
Only needs to work in space so no concern for aerodynamic shape
Split in ascent and descent stages: both land, only ascent stage leaves.

#### Descent Stage

![IMG_2852.jpeg](img_2852.jpeg)
Descent stage has liquid fuel engine called **Lunar Module Descent Engine** (max 43.6 kN thrust, used at 4.67 kN) powered by 2 fuel tanks and 2 oxidizer tanks.
Descent stage also has 4 quadrants for carrying stuff:

1. general storage, on late flights lunar rover
2. water tank and Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package (ALSAP)
3. helium tank, oxygen tank, and sometimes retro-reflectors
4. Modularized Equipment Storage Assembly (MESA), including camera recording first steps on moon

#### Ascent Stage

Ascent stage has **Ascent Propulsion Systems**
generating 16 kN thrust.
Made of Crew Compartment, Midsection and Aft Equipment Bay:

* Crew Compartment is pressurized (safe without suit), little room, 2 small windows, commander on left and pilot on right. Opens for climb down the ladder
* Midsection has equipment and cover to protect ascent engine, and tunnel to dock with command module when back to lunsr orbit
* Aft Equipment Bay has oxygen and helium tanks and electronics, feeding into ascent engine
* [[Reaction Control System]] (RCS), 4 groups of 4 thrusters each for maneuvering
* Antennas for talking to mission control on Earth

## Launch Center To Orbit Steps

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dpkmUjJ8xU
0\. 4 arms of umbilical tower move away

1. First stage ignites 8 seconds before launch
2. Other 5 arms move away to let rocket fly away
3. First stage shuts off at 2:42 at height of 67km and [[Explosive Bolts]] remove it
4. Second stage starts. Launch escape system not needed anymore, gets removed
5. Second stage shuts off at 9:12 at height of 175km and is removed
6. Third stage fires up for a bit to get to [[Earth Orbits#Parking Orbit|Parking Orbit]] at 190 km
7. Third stage shuts off at 11:39 at parking orbit, **remains attached**

## Orbit To Moon Steps

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tl1KPjxKVqk
0\. Currently in Parking Orbit at 190km with third stage turned off

1. Orbit earth 2-3 times to confirm systems work
2. **Translunar Injection**: ignite third stage for 6 minutes to get to trajectory where moon will eventually catch the spacecraft
3. After those 6 minutes, adapter lunar module detaches, exposes spacecraft parts
4. Command and service module move front, turn 180 degrees, and dock with lunar module to pull it out
5. **Passive Thermal Control** (PTC) (“Barbecue Roll”) - spacecraft goes into slow roll to prevent heating or freezing
6. When behind the moon, **Lunar Orbit Insertion** starts - thruster fired for 6 minutes to slow down spacecraft (currently no contact with mission control due to being on far side of moon)
7. 2 astronauts get in lunar module (LM), one stays in command and service module (CSM) in orbit
8. LM extends legs and separates from CSM and moves about 3.2km from CSM before descent
9. **Descent Orbit Insertion**: engines fire up for 30 seconds, bring LM at 15 km above lunar surface
10. **Power Descent Initiation**: engine fires up again, windows pointing down first, then forward so astronauts see. Landing site must be even terrain. Limited fuel so limited time to pick place
11. **Touchdown**

## Return Steps

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt\_xoCXLXnI

0. 2 astronauts on the moon with Lunar Module, 1 waiting in lunar orbit with command and service modules
1. Astronauts get in ascent stage
2. Ascent stage’s engine fires up for 7:30, gets back in linar orbit, descent stage left behind
3. Several short engine burns for next 3.5 hours to get ascent stage closer to CSM. Takes almost 2 orbits to get close enough for docking (later Apollo missions did in less than 1 orbit)
4. **Docking** ![IMG_2853.jpeg](img_2853.jpeg)
5. Information, materials and crew transfer to command module, ascent stage left behind in lunar orbit on smashed on moon
6. **Trans-Earth Injection** - on far side of moon, service module engine fires up for 2:30
7. 3 day journey, all crew in command module
8. When in Earth’s orbit, service module removed
9. **Reentry**
   * bottom of command module (previously covered by service module) has a heat shield
   * Aircraft carrier waits for astronauts
   * When 3.2 km above surface, parachutes deploy
   * **Splashdown** in water
