* Pressurized modules where life goes
* **Integrated Truss Structure (ITS)** - internal and external trusses that act as support beams for solar panels and heat shields and everything
* Solar arrays
* **Environmental Control and Life Support Systems (ECLSS)** - oxygen/carbon dioxide recycling, water/urine recycling, atmospheric pressure
* Robot parts like [[Canadarm2]] and [[Dextre]]

## ECLSS

* Oxygen generation - electrolysis to split water into oxygen and hydrogen
* CO<sub>2</sub> removal with **Carbon Dioxide Removal Assembly (CDRA)**
* Trace Contaminant Control
* **Water Recovery System (WRS)** - recycles wastewater into drinkable water (98% water successfully reused currently)
* **Urine Processor Assembly (UPA)** - distills urine to reclaim water, then cleaned by WRS
* Temperature and humidity control
* Fire Safety
