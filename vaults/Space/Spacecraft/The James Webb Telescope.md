Best telescope to this day
Sees in infrared
![IMG\_3034.jpeg](img_3034.jpeg)
Launched on 25 December 2021 with [[Ariane 5]] rocket
Made together by NASA, ESA and CSA
Cost $10 billion

At 1.5 million km above Earth at Second Lagrange Point (L<sub>2</sub>)

## Goal

Study early universe, star formation and exoplanets

## Design

### Primary Mirror

18 hexagonal segments made of beryllium coated with thin layer of gold - optimized for reflecting infrared.
Together, segments form 6.5 meter wide mirror ([[Hubble space telescope]] has 2.4 meters).
Segments adjustable with actuators

### Secondary Mirror

Smaller, circular, in front of primary
Reflects collected light toward scientific instruments

### Tertiary Mirror and Fine Steering Mirror

Further refine and direct light to scientific instruments.
Fine steering mirror compensates vibrations and other instabilities

### Scientific Instruments

* Near-infrared camera (NIRCam)
  * Primary
  * wavelengths 0.6-5 microns
* Near-infrared spectrograph (NIRSpec)
  * For spectroscopy (analyze light into physical/chemical components)
* Mid-infrared Instrument (MIRI)
  * wavelengths 5-28 microns
  * cooler objects like distant galaxies and exoplanets
* Fine guidance sensor (FGS) / Near InfraRed Imager and Slitless Spectrograph (NIRISS)
  * Precise pointing, captures unique data

### Cryogenic Cooling System

* Sunshield - 5-layer Kapton shield coated with reflective materials. Keeps telescope at -233 degrees C on cold side
* Cryocooler - cools MIRI to -266 degrees C for best performance

### Comms

Sends data to Earth with **Ka-band antenna**
Receives data with **S-band system**

## Engineering Innovations

* Beryllium mirror - lightweight, strong, thermally stable at cryogenic temperatures
* Actuators for each mirror accurate down to nanometers
* Kapton for sunshield stable under extreme temperatures
* Autonomous deployment succeeded with over 300 single-point failure mechanisms
