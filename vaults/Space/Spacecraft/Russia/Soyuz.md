Crew of 3
Started in 1967, still in use
Operated by Roscosmos
50 meters tall
Spacecraft covered in at the top in **Launch Shroud**

Currently used to take people to and from [[International Space Station]].
Became only way to take crew after [[Space Shuttle]] retired in 2011 till 2021 when SpaceX made [[Crew Dragon]]

Fuel: kerosene and LOX

## 3 Stages

1. 4 side boosters and central block
2. central block
3. smaller block
4. Launch Shroud holding spacecraft
5. Launch Escape Tower for emergency during launch. Stabilizing grid find will deploy and additional rockets and parachutes will make sure of safe deploy

Most engines at bottom. Large ones fixed, small ones (vernier engines) rotate.
2 verniers on each side booster, 4 on central block

## Assembly

Assembled few km away from launchpad
Steps:

1. Spacecraft tested for defects in **Building 254**
2. Spacecraft turned and loaded in Launch Shroud
3. Moved to **Building 112**
4. Rocket assembled horizontally
5. **Rollout** - 2-3 days before launch, transported to launch site on a small train
6. Each engine is covered in red protective surface, removed before liftoff
7. Rocket and train slowly approach launch pad
8. Rocket is lifted up and 4 support trusses hold it
9. 2 umbilical towers attach to give power and fuel
10. 2 service towers where people can interact with rocket from, including crew entering

## Launch

From Kazakhstan because it's closer to equator than Russia and that's an advantage as it gives a speed boost because land at equator moves faster.
Takes ~9 minutes

0. 5 hours before launch, tanks get filled
1. Crew use portable cooling units, take photo and take elevator to get in spacecraft. Entered from orbital module and get in descent module
2. 30 min before launch service arms rotate away
3. 15 min before launch people leave launch pad
4. 35 seconds before launch first umbilical tower released
5. 15 seconds before launch second umbilical tower released
6. Moment of liftoff: support trusses move away, engines fire (launch automated but crew ready for emergency)
7. 20 seconds after liftoff pitches over to side
8. 2 min after liftoff launch escape tower removed (no longer needed)
9. Side boosters empty and get removed (Korolev Cross)
10. Crew feel 3.5 g
11. At 2.5 min Launch Shroud removed (no need to protect spacecraft past atmosphere), crew see space
12. 5 min second stage almost done, third stage already starts before removing second
13. Second stage removed
14. At 9 minutes third stage shuts off (main engine cutoff or MICO) and soon removes
15. At 240km, speed 27 000 kph, 0g starts, antennas and solar panels deploy

Crew spends 6 months on ISS

## Return

Takes 3.5 hours
0\. goodbyes

1. crew enter spacecraft, close all hatches and get in seats in descent module
2. **Undocking** - hard lock latches release and detach
3. Slowly float away from ISS
4. Deorbit burn: main engine fires for 4:30 pointed backward to lower orbit
5. After 30 min, turn 90 degrees and modules separate
6. Service and orbital module burn up in atmosphere
7. Descent module has heat shield
8. **Reentry** - small thrusters steer launcher: Several g s on crew. Radio blackout: can’t communicate
9. Touchdown starts (can optionally splashdown)
10. 2 pilot parachutes, 1 drogue parachute and 1 main parachute open. Backup parachute present
11. Heat shield removed, soft landing thrusters removed, seats rise up
12. Soft landing thrusters fired 1 meter above ground
13. Touchdown
14. Recovery crew helps astronauts get out

## Spacecraft

We discuss Soyuz MS, the latest one.
Outside is covered by layers of fabric for thermal insulation.
Has 2 antennas, 1 window in front to look out, 1 docking camera, 1 LED light system, and 1 docking station in front.
![Pasted_image_20241025224939.png](pasted_image_20241025224939.png)
On top there is a satellite communications antenna, solar panels, thrusters on side and back, and covered main engine in middle

Periscope for crew to look out on lower side

Docked with [[Saturn V|Apollo Spacecraft]] for Apollo-Soyuz Test Project (ASTP) on July 1975

### Modules

![IMG_2876.png](img_2876.png)

* Orbital - “Habitation Module”. Pressurized. More comfortable and where crew mostly live. Closed hatch opens between orbital and descent modules. ![IMG_2878.png](img_2878.png)
* Descent - pressurized, 3 seats, emergency life support system, and survival gear for after landing back. Only this module returns on earth ![IMG_2877.png](img_2877.png)
* Service - AKA “instrument module” or “propulsion module” - fuel tanks, oxygen tanks, extra batteries and truss structure (metal diagonals above green balls)  ![IMG_2880.png](img_2880.png)

After slowly raising apogee then perigee then again apogee and so till it gets to same orbit, Soyuz docks with ISS at one of these locations. There can be multiple Soyuz/[[Progress Spacecraft]] attached at the same time. US segment of ISS is incompatible with Russian docking system SSVP (translates to "System for docking and internal transfer").
Ducking: probe of Soyuz attaches to Drobe of ISS, making airtight seal and then opening and astronauts pass through it
