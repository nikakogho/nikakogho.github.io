Model to simplify calculations. Chemical rocket usually 1-6% below predicted level

## Assumptions
1. homogenous working fluid
2. nearly all working fluid is gaseous
3. fluid obeys perfect gas law
4. adiabatic flow - no heat transfer with walls
5. no friction
6. no shock waves or any discontinuities
7. constant exhaust velocity. uniform expansion of working fluid
8. Transient effects (start-up and shutdown) are short enough to be ignored
9. exhaust gases travel parallel to nozzle axis
10. gass velocity, pressure and temperature are constant on any surface normal to nozzle axis
11. chemical equilibrium in chamber and constant gas composition
12. ordinary propellants at ambient temperatures, cryogenic ones at boiling points
