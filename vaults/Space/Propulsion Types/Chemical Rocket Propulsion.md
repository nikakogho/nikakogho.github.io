Fuel + oxidizer

1. Product heated to 2500-4100 degress celsius
2. product gases expanded in supersonic nozzle and accelerated to 1800-4300 m/s (twice the melting point of steel so must be insulated to not melt the rocket)

Types:

* liquid
* solid
* gaseous
* hybrid

## Liquid Propellant Rocket

Liquid fuel fed under pressure from tank to thrust chamber.
Sometimes can run for hours

Separate tank for oxidizer and propellant

**Bipropelant** - fuel (like kerosene) and oxidizer (like liquid oxygen) are separate, come together in thrust chamber

**Monopropelant** - one tank, released energy by decomposition. Usually hydrazine (N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>)

## Gas Propellant Rocket

For low-thrust, low total energy propulsion systems like attitude control (rotation toward horizon), often >1 thrust chamber per engine.

Use high pressure gas like air/nitrogen/helium.
Need relatively heavy tanks. Stored cold.

Sometimes warmed up with a monoproppant. called *worm gas propellant rocket*.

## Solid Propellant Motor

Called motor for historical reasons

No tank, rocket directly holds solid fuel called *grain* ready to burn with ignition.
Once ignited, burns at constant rate.
**Canâ€™t be shut off.**

## Hybrid Propellant

Like liquid oxydizer with solid fuel
