Low thrust => takes longer to accelerate
Needs less propellant

## Electrothermal

Propellant heated with resistors called resistojets or electric arcs called arcjets

Thrust range 0.01N - 0.5N
Exhaust velocity 1000 - 7800 m/s

Propellant: ammonium, hydrogen, nitrogen or hydrazinede composition products

## Electrostatic

AKA ion propulsion thrusters

Working fluid (like xenon) is ionized and speeds up in electrostatic field.
Then ions are electrically neutralized by combining with emitted electrons to prevent build up of charge in rocket

## Electromagnetic

Plasma is accelerated by electric and magnetic fields and ejected at velocity 1000 - 75000 m/s
