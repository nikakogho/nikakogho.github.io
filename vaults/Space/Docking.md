Process is automated

## Steps
1. Spacecraft first fixes its altitude to be same as target.
2. Slowly increases apogee at perigee then perigee at apogee until on same orbit as target.
3. **Fly around** - small impulse burns from all sides to approach
4. **Station keeping** - making sure the two spacecraft can keep constant distance between them
5. **Final approach** - 100 meters to go, moving at a few cm/s. Docking camera on spacecraft aligns with docking port on target
6. **Contact** - probe of spacecraft touches drobe of target
7. **Soft capture** - attached but not fully
8. **Hard capture** - probe retracts, hooks from target get working and lock the spacecraft in place
9. Electrical data exchanged
10. Vestibule (area that attaches directly) gets pressurized, takes 1-2 hours
11. Attaching part opens so astronauts can move in
