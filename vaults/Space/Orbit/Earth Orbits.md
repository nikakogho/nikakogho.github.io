**Karman Line** - Start of space, 80-100km
**Low Earth Orbit** - 800-2000 km
**Medium Earth Orbit** - 2000-35786 km
**High Earth Orbit** - Apogee at 35786 km

**Second Lagrange Point (L<sub>2</sub>)** - at 1.5 million km, best because Earth and Sun gravities balance such that spacecraft here orbits sun at same rate as Earth

**Geosynchronous orbit** - orbit that takes exactly 23 hours 56 minutes 4 seconds for rotation

**Polar orbit** - inclination = 90 degrees, covers entire surface of Earth

## Parking Orbit

Temporary orbit to first get into, before moving into desired orbit

## Lagrange Points

5 points denoting distances between 2 objects

* First Lagrange Point - between 2 objects
* Second Lagrange Point - on line connecting objects, beyond smaller object
* Third Lagrange Point - beyond larger object
* L4 and L5 - leading and trailing smaller body (Earth), form equilateral triangle
  * L4 60 degrees ahead of smaller body
  * L5 60 degrees behind
  * **Stable equilibrium points**
