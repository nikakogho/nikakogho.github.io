In a short classic, Valentino Braitenberg demonstrates that minimal sensor → motor loops can produce behaviors—fear, curiosity, even “love”—that feel indistinguishable from true life.

That realization flips a switch: **what if our own thoughts and emotions are nothing more than layers of clever wiring?** If a toy car can mimic “curiosity” with five lines of logic, where does true consciousness begin?

My **code** for Unity2D demos will follow soon. For now, here’s the **empty** GitHub repo as a placeholder:

> **Questions to ponder:**  
> 1. At what point does a reactive machine become an “agent”?  
> 2. How might layering state and memory change your sense of what’s alive?  
> 3. If a few well placed wires can give robots every behavior we associate with living beings from love, fear, exploration, aggression, to bonding and predicting, are animals (and even humans) really any different from robots?

Stay tuned for the first robots: love, fear, aggression and exploration.
I’d love to hear your perspective.
