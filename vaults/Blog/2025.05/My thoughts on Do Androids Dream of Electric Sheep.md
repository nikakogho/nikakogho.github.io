This book is clearly the inspiration for "Blade Runner": destroyed earth, androids almost but not completely same as people, main character hunting them down and questioning the morality of it, dark ending.

Can something like this happen? Hm, the Chinese do have an attempt at making androids that look like people. And projects like [Clone Robotics](https://clonerobotics.com/) certainly come close. But the way this book suggests it, with internal organs being same and all that, no that's too far. At that point they're not androids anymore, they're bioengineered people. Yeah, people. This idea that androids will step by step become so similar to humans that they even copy internal organs and what we are made of, I call bullshit on that. That's not a step by step change. That's a complete rewrite. That's just cloning and growing in a vat, **NOT** an assembly process.

Regardless, since skin can look human, and even actually [**be** human](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD8UncqzmZ0), androids' ability to fool humans will indeed keep getting better.

This feels like a much better definition of the Turing Test: when even a detective can't tell if it's looking at a human or an android. But, again, I call bullshit on faking internal organs.

As for the moral question: yeah, I think eventually robots will get emotions, fear, love, anger, sadness, everything, including empathy, and maybe also subjective experience, qualia (yeah they might get emotions without qualia. How? By acting like they have emotions but acting so well that they also believe it. Like they will actually cry at movies even if no one is observing them and such).
And I do believe we must eventually give them rights.

How much rights? Well, currently it is my understanding that we have come up with a sort of hierarchy for rights: rights of bacteria < fly < mouse < pig < monkey < human

So I guess they should go somewhere between monkey and human at first and eventually maybe on equal footing with people. Idk I don't understand consciousness well enough to answer this for now, will come back to this question after I do
