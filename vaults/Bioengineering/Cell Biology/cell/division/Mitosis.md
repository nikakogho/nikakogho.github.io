* Prophase - centrioles start moving away, nucleolus disappears, [[Spindle Apparatus]]
  * Prometaphase - nuclear envelope is breaking down, microtubules grew enough to reach chromosomes from edge, connected to their centres (centromeres)
* Metaphase - chromosomes lined up on "equator"
* Anaphase - chromatids broken apart and start moving to poles
* Telophase - nucleus forms around chromosomes, each side duplicates chromatids
* [[Cytokinesis]] - cell breaks into two
