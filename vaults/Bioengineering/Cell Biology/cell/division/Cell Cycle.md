* G<sub>0</sub> - resting phase, entered because no need to divide or not enough resources to divide
* Interphase - 90% of time
  * G<sub>1</sub> - first gap (growth). Some organelles doubled, building materials for synthesis
    * some cells like nerve cells stay here forever and don't divide
  * S - DNA synthesis, DNA helix separates and duplicates
  * G<sub>2</sub> - second gap (growth), preparation for M Phase
* Mitosis (M) Phase
  * [[Mitosis]]
    * Prophase
    * Metaphase
    * Anaphase
    * Telophase
  * [[Cytokinesis]]
