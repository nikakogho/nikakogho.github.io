Infectious microbe made of a segment of nucleic acid ([[DNA]] or [[RNA]]) surrounded by protein coat.
Can't replicate itself, infects and uses host cells for replication.
Technically not alive.

Infect one cell, emerge with protective wrapping, infect another cell (possibly different species), repeat.

Bacteriophages are viruses that infect bacteria/archaea.

Sometimes viruses kill hosts, sometimes their DNA stays there as [[Plasmid|plasmids]] or gets inserted in genome.

Might pick up genome from one cell and give it to another, very common in [[Prokaryotes|prokaryotes]].
