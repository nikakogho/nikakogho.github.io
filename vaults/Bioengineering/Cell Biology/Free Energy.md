Energy available for increasing disorder (entropy).
∆G measures this.
Reactions occur when ∆G < 0.
∆G depends on properties and concentrations of molecules.

Can be calculated either with <i>equilibrium constant</i> K or standard free-energy change ∆G°

∆G° is ∆G under standard conditions (where all concentrations are 1 mole/liter), depends only on properties of molecules
