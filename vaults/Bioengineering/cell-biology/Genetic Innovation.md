There are 4 ways genes can change:

1. Intragenic mutation - DNA replication or other process brings random error in DNA
2. Gene duplication - One cell accidentally gets two same genes, may diverge later
3. DNA segment shuffling - genes can break and form into hybrid genes
4. Horizontal (intercellular) transfer - DNA moved from one cell to another (even other species)
