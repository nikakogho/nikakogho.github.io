Also called ECM or scaffold

Area between [[Cell|cells]].
Holds nutrients, signaling molecules, various [[Protein|proteins]], [[Blood]] vessels, [[Nervous Tissue]]

## Cell-Matrix Adhesion
Helped by [[Integrin]] proteins that act like hands on cells and grab parts of ECM

## Creation
After cells connect to each other with adhesion and proliferate to right amount, they start building ECM:
- [[Collagen]] as support beams
- [[Elastin]] for elasticity
- [[Proteoglycan|Proteoglycans]] = protein + [[Sugar|sugars]]
    - hold water
    - cushioning + hydration
- “Molecular Glue” - Adhesive [[Glycoprotein]]
    - Bind to cell with integrin
    - Bind to ecm with collagen and proteoglycans
    - Examples:
        - Fibronectin
        - Laminin
    - 

## Tissue Specificity
### Bone ECM
Dense, lots if Type I collagen and lots of calcium phosphate minerals to make it hard

### Cartilage ECM
Type II collagen and aggrecan (big proteoglycan). Hydrated gel to resist compression

### Tendon ECM
Dense, aligned Type I collagen for high tensile strength in 1 direction

### Skin ECM
Mix of:
- Types I and III collagen
- Elastin
- Proteoglycans
