## Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum (RER)

Is rough because of \[\[Ribosome|ribosomes]] on surface.
Created proteins get moved to lumen (inside of RER) where folding, glycosylation (adding \[\[Sugar Moieties|sugar moieties]]) and disulfide bonds (-S-S- bond) happen.
Then packaged into \[\[Vesicle|vesicles]] and transported to other places like \[\[Golgi apparatus]].

## Smooth Endoplasmic Reticulum (SER)

For synthesis of lipids, metabolism of \[\[Carbohydrate|carbs]] and \[\[Steroids|steroids]].
Detoxifying harmfull stuff.
Stores calcium.
Glucose Formation.
