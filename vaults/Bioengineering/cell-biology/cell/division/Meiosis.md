Divides into gametes (sperm and egg cells).
Division of sex cells.
Makes haploid (one set of chromosomes) cells that combine into a \[\[Zygote|zygote]].

Steps are **Meiosis 1** and **Meiosis 2** and result in **4** child cells each with half as many chromosomes as original.

## Meiosis 1

Homologous \[\[Chromosome|chromosomes]] (same chromosome from each parent) separate.
Results in 2 haploid child cells.
"Reductional division".

Steps:

* Prophase Ɪ - takes 90% of time. \[\[Spindle Apparatus]] forms. Homologous chromosomes kinda pair up, microtubules grow. Some homologous chromosomes exchange parts, gaining new genes - *chiasma*
* Metaphase Ɪ - same as in \[\[Mitosis|mitosis]], align at "equator"
* Anaphase Ɪ - same as in mitosis, chromosome breaks apart and gets pulled to poles
* Telophase Ɪ - wrap up into separate sections
* Cytokinesis - cell divides

## Meiosis 2

Sister chromatids separate.
Results in 4 haploid cells.
"Equational division".

Steps:

* Prophase ꞮꞮ - Spindle apparatus forms.
* Metaphase ꞮꞮ - align on "equator", chromosomes connect to kinetochores
* Anaphase ꞮꞮ - chromatids split and move to poles
* Telophase ꞮꞮ - separate nuclei form
* Cytokinesis - cells split
