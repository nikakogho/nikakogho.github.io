A [[Protein|protein]] to bind [[Cell|cell]] to [[Extracellular Matrix]]

Is like a hand on a cell and binds to something in ECM.

Commonly binds to:
- Fibronectin
- Laminin
- Vitronectin
- [[Collagen]]

Binding also triggers signals inside cell (**outside-in signaling**) and can influence cell's
- Shape
- Movement
- Survival
- [[Gene]] expression

Cell can also adjust integrin parameters (**inside-out signaling**)

For [[Tissue Engineering]], artificial scaffolds are often made coated with fibronectin or other proteins so cells bind to it
