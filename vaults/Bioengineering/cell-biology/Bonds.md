Subunits (sugars, amino acids, nucleotids) bond with covalent bonds (shared electrons on outer ring) into a macromolecule.

Macromolecules use weak noncovalent bonds to gather into larger structures like robosomes.

## Types of noncovalent bonds:

* Ionic bonds - positive ion bonding with negative ion
* Hydrogen bonds - shared hydrogen
* Van der Waals attractions - neutral, nonpolar molecules bonding
* Hydrophobic bond - nonpolar groups interacting as a result of being thrown away from water
