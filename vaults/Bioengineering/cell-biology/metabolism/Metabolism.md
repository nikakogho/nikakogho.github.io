Process of turning food into energy.
Comprised of catabolic and anabolic processes:

## Catabolic

Break down foodstuff into smaller molecules and useful forms of energy. Works with \[\[Coenzymes|NADH]]

## Anabolic (biosynthetic)

Use material gained from catabolic reactions to build new molecules. Works with \[\[Coenzymes|NADPH]]
