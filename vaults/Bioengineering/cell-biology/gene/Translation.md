\[\[RNA]] is used to create \[\[Amino acids]] that form into \[\[Protein]] (\[\[Protein Synthesis]]).

Process is mostly identicall in all life.

Data in mRNA is read 3 nucleotides at a time. This triplet is called codon.
1 codon = 1 amino acid.
Total of 4<sup>3</sup> = 64 possible codons (A, U, G or C at each nucleotide).
Total of 20 possible amino acids, meaning some codons give same amino acid.

**1 START codon (AUG - methionine) starts** the process.
**3 STOP codons (UAA, UAG, UGA) stop** the process.

Each type of tRNA attaches to one end of a type of amino acid and displays at other end an <i>anticodon</i> that uses base-pairing to recognize a specific codon/codon group.
Chemistry for this happens in \[\[Ribosome]].

Same RNA can be translated differently, especially in complex genomes like plants and animals.
