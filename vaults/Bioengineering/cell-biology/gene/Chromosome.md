Sex chromosomes are X and Y.
Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes (46 total)

Proteins that bind DNAs into chromosomes can either be **histones** or **nonhistone chromosomal proteins**

## Histones

Histones create [[Nucleosome]]

### Histone Octamer

8 positively charged histones that assist in protein packaging

Histones have + charge
DNA's sugar-phosphate backbone has - charge
This helps bonding

## Nonhistone chromosomal proteins

## DNA Packing

Exact structures are still uncertain

## DNA exposing

Can be exposed by:

1. *Chromatin-remodeling complex*, a protein that reveals or hides DNA. ATP hydrolysis gives energy to loosen DNA around nucleosome and push along histone octamer, eventually exposing or hiding it.

2. *Histone-modifying enzymes* - catalyzing reversible chemical reactions mostly affecting tails of the 4 core histones. This can add/remove acetyl, phosphate, or methyl groups, or serve as docking site for regulatory proteins
