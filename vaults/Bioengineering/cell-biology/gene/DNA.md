Deoxyribonucleic acid

Made of a sequence of [[Nucleotide|nucleotides]]

Polymers are chained with [[Phosphate]].

Base connects to [[Sugar]] (deoxyribose - C5H10O4) with strong covalent bond, connects to other identical side with weak hydrogen bond.

Polymer has identical side on other end (A-T, G-C) that forms a double-helix pattern.

Each turn in spiral has 10 bases

Uses [[DNA Replication]]

DNA data is read by [[Transcription]] then [[Translation]].
Cell adjusts transcription and translation rate based on need using regulatory DNA (part of non-coding DNA).
Regulatory DNA binds to proteins that control rate of transcription.

Is precious and fixed.

Some DNA sequences signal end for the segment which goes into one mRNA.
Each such segment is a [[Gene]].

RNA taken from same DNA sequence can be translated differently.

## Junk DNA

98% of DNA is not used to form proteins.
Can work on regulating gene action or building ribosomes.
Might be a completely useless leftover from evolution.
