PCR

Way to multiply DNA

We take DNA we want to multiply and we take a bunch of primers (complementary single strands of DNA) and we also need DNA polymerase and we go:

1. heat up at 94 degrees Celsius so DNA denatures and becomes single strands
2. cool down to 54 degrees Celsius so primers start to stick to single DNA strands
3. warm up to 72 degrees Celsius so DNA polymerase can bind to where primer ends and start building complementary side of DNA
4. repeat

Made by Kary Mullis in 1983, got Nobel Prize for it in 1993
