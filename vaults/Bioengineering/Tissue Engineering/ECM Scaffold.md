Artificial placeholder for [[Extracellular Matrix]] used in [[Tissue Engineering]]

Purposes:

* Mechanical support
* Porosity (interconnected) to allow nutrient flow, cell infiltration and waste removal
* 3D shape template
* Guides cell behavior through chemoattractants and repellents

## Biomaterials for Scaffold

* Natural polymers
  * Allogeneic or xenogeneic
  * Pro: sometimes easy to get
  * Cons
    * Hard to scale
    * Each may differ
    * Immune rejection risk
* Synthetic polymers
  * Pro: can mass manufacture and give custom structural strength
  * Con: can't adapt to changing environment
* Ceramics
* Composite materials

### Common Synthetic Polymers for Scaffold

* Aliphatic [[Polyester|polyesters]] - biodegradable through hydrolysis
* Poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)
* Polyurethanes (PUs)

### Aliphatic Polyesters

Aliphatic - carbons in backbone form open chains

Con: degradation releases acid, may harm body

Types:

* Polylactic Acid (PLA)
  * [[Lactic Acid]] [[Monomer|monomer]]
  * Hydrophobic
  * Strong, stiff, brittle
  * Degradation releases lactic acid
  * Used in bone, cartilage, sutures, and 3D printing
* Polyglycolic Acid (PGA)
  * [[Glycolic Acid]] monomer
  * Hydrophilic, so degrades faster
  * Crystalline
  * Degradation releases glycolic acid
  * One of the first to be used. Often combined with PLA
* Poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA)
  * ![PLGA.png](plga.png)
  * Co-polymer: lactic acid and glycolic acid monomers chained together
  * **Tunability**: changing lactic acid to glycolic acid ratio changes properties
  * Degradation releases both
  * Used for controlled drug delivery and as scaffold for bone, cartilage, nerves, skin...
* Polycaprolactone (PCL)
  * [[ε-caprolactone]] monomer
  * Hydrophobic and semi-crystalline so degrades very slowly
  * Flexible and tougher than PLA and PGA
  * High biocompatibility
  * Safe degradation
  * Used for long term implants due to slow degradation
  * Used as scaffold for bone, cartilage, tendon, ligament, cardiovascular

### Poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)

[[Polyether]] (monomers linked by [[Ether Bond|ether bonds]])

* [[Ehylene Glycol]] monomer (repeating units of -O-CH₂-CH₂-)
* Hydrophilic
* Bio-inert
  * No bonds
  * No immune reaction
  * No blood clotting
* Crosslinked - many chains bridged to each other to form 3D network called [[Hydrogel]]
* Cell adhesion peptides must be added artificially **before** crosslinking
* Used for drug delivery or as tunable hydrogel to encapsulate cells and tissues

### Polyurethanes (PUs)

Polymers with [[Urethane Linkage|urethane linkages]].
Different monomers.
Can be very soft and elastic or rigid.
Used for catheters, pacemaker leads, parts of artificial hearts, or when good elasticity is needed in tissue engineering
