Tell [[Cell|cells]] how fast, in what order, for how long, in what direction to grow into [[Extracellular Matrix]] during both [[Embryonic Development]] and in [[Tissue Engineering]] or [[Regeneration]].

## Controls
### Proliferation Speed
**Mitogens** (class of [[Growth Factors]]) tell cells to enter [[Cell Cycle]] and divide.
Concentration of mitogens = proliferation speed.

### [[Cell Differentiation]] Direction
Telling a [[Stem Cells|stem cell]] what type of cell to specialize into.

Example: [[BMP-2]] tells a **mesenchymal** (bone) stem cell to turn into bone-forming [[Osteoblast]], while TGF-Î²3 tells same mesenchymal stem cell to become [[Cartilage]]-forming [[Chondrocyte]]

### [[Cell Migration]] Direction
Gradients of signaling molecules (chemoattractants) make chemical highways that cells move on

### Order
A tissue engineer might first bathe [[ECM Scaffold]] with mitogens to fill scaffold with a type of stem cell, then use differentiation signalers and then add other factors for ECM production and organization

### Stopping
Signaling molecule can
- tell a cell to stop growing (enter senescence)
- tell a cell to die (apoptosis)

## Types
### [[Growth Factors]]
[[Protein|Proteins]] that stimulate cell growth, proliferation, healing and differentiation.
Most relevant for tissue engineering.

### Cytokines
Signalers for [[Immune System|immune responses]].
Like interleukins (ILs) and interferons (IFs), for controlling inflammation.

### [[Hormone|Hormones]]
Travel through [[Blood|bloodstream]] to act on distant organs.
