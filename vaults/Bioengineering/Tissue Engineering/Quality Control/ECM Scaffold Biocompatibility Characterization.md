Most important part of [[ECM Scaffold Characterization]].

Must ensure the [[ECM Scaffold]] is not cytotoxic and will support the desired cellular responses (adhesion, proliferation, differentiation).

## In Vitro Techniques
### Cytotoxicity Assays
Cells cultured either inside scaffold or in similar conditions, and after time evaluated.

Methods:
- Live/Dead Staining - we use fluorescent dyes that stain live and dead cells in different color
- Metabolic Assays (MTT, MTS, AlamarBlue...) - colorimetric assays where a reagent is added to cells. Living cells convert this into color. We measure how much color we got (proportional to living cells amount)

### Cell Adhesion and Proliferation Assays
Cells seeded directly on scaffold. Attachment and growth checked over time.

Methods:
- Microscopy - SEM or fluorescence microscopy (after staining) used to check if cells attached, spread out, formed a connected (confluent) layer on surface
- Cell counting / DNA quantification - number of cells counted by breaking them open (lysing) and measuring total DNA present. Increase in DNA means proliferation

### Cell Differentiation Assays
We take [[Stem Cells]] and check if scaffold guides them to become specialized cells.

Methods:
- Gene expression - using methods like qPCR to see if genes specific to that cell are turned on
- Protein expression - using immunofluorescence or other ways to detect presence of specific proteins that only that specialized cell would produce
- Functional markers - checking specific features like calcium deposition for [[Bone|bone-forming]] cells
