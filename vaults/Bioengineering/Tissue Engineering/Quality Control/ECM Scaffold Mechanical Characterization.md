A technique in [[ECM Scaffold Characterization]].
To make sure it won't break or deform under stress.
Especially important for [[Bone]], [[Cartilage]] and such.

## Techniques
### Tensile Testing
Clamped at both ends and pulled apart, we measure what force stretched it to what distance

Measured properties:
- Young's Modulus (Elastic Modulus) - stiffness (how hard it is to stretch/bend). Metal is high, rubber is low
- Tensile Strength (or Ultimate Tensile Strength (UTS)) - max force before breaking
- Elongation at Break - how long it got before breaking

### Compression Testing
Placed between 2 plates and compressed at constant rate. We record force and change in height

Measured properties:
- Compressive Strength - max stress before falling apart
- Compressive Modulus - stiffness under compression

### Shear / Torsional Testing
Measure scaffold's response to shear (sliding) or torsion (twisting) forces.
Important for cartilage in [[Joint|joints]] or intervertebral discs

### Dynamic Mechanical Analysis (DMA)
More sophisticated.
Small oscillating force applied to sample, response measured.

Measured properties:
- How stiffness and energy dissipation change with temperature, loading frequency, or over time in fluid
- Good for **viscoelastic** materials (which have both viscosity and elasticity) like [[Hydrogel|hydrogels]] or natural tissues
