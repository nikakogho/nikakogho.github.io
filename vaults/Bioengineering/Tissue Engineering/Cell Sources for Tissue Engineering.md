- Autologous - from patient directly
    - pro: perfect immune compatibility
    - con: hard to sample and grow, especially if diseased which it probably is if we are bothering with tissue engineering in that place
- Allogeneic - from another human (relative or not)
    - pro: more available, can be healthier
    - con: immune rejection risk
- Xenogeneic - from another animal
    - pro: far more available
    - con: hard immune rejection + zoonoses (animal diseases)
- induced Pluripotent Stem Cells
    - can revert patientâ€™s cells to [[Stem Cells]]
