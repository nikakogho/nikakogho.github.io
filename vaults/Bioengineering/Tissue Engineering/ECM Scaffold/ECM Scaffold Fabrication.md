Ways to make [[ECM Scaffold]] for [[Tissue Engineering]].

Has different methods because:

1. different [[Biomaterials for ECM Scaffold|biomaterials]] have different needs
2. some need large scale vs others need fine grained details
3. some cheap ways are sometimes ok other times we need expensive ways

## Conventional Methods

### Solvent Casting and Particulate Leaching (SCPL)

For synthetic polymers that can take drying and are solvent-soluble

Steps:

1. Polymer Dissolution - chosen synthetic polymer (PLA, PGA...) is dissolved in organic solvent (chloroform, dichloromethane...) to make a polymer solution
2. Porogen Addition - porogen particles (pore-creators) are added and mixed for uniform distribution. Size and amount of these particles determines pore properties
3. Casting and Solvent Evaporation - solution cast into mold of desired shape and allowed to evaporate slowly, leaving behind solid composite of polymer with porogens inside
4. Particulate Leaching - put in bath of liquid to wash away the porogens but keep polymer (takes 1-2 days)
5. Drying - air-drying or freeze-drying to get final scaffold

Pros:

* Easy
* Can get high porosities 70-90%
* Can adjust pore size by porogen size and pore amount by porogen-polymer ratio

Cons:

* Hard to get pore interconnectivity
* Leftover solvents can harm cells
* Irregular pore shapes since they were made by porogen particles that could've been cubic
* Hard to make thick scaffolds
* Mostly only for synthetic polymers

### Gas Foaming

Mostly with synthetic polymers, a way to make porous structures without organic solvents

Solid polymer is filled with pressured gas like CO<sub>2</sub> and then pressure is released so gas bubbles form and create pores

Steps:

1. synthetic polymer sample put in high pressure chamber
2. filled with gas, usually supercritical CO<sub>2</sub> at 800+ psi for hours or days to saturate
3. pressure release - CO<sub>2</sub> escapes from polymer and creates pores along the way
4. then with cooling and drying the structure is stabilized

Controls:

* Pore size controlled by pressure release speed (quick release means many small pores, small means few large pores)
* Porosity also controlled by saturation pressure and temperature (higher saturation => more porosity)
* Pore interconnectivity is a problem, sometimes helped by mixing particulate leaching and other methods
  * For example, mix with SCPL would be to mix porogens first, then do gas foaming, the leach out those porogens for interconnectivity
* Shape is mostly same as starting polymer, with a little expansion

### Freeze Drying (Lyophilization)

For natural and some synthetic polymers

Polymer and solvent (mostly water) together are frozen, then quickly dried so frozen solvent dries up and wherever its ice crystals were become pores

Slow freeze => larger and longer ice crystals.
Fast freeze => smaller and more uniform ice crystals.

Primary drying (sublimation) - placed in freeze-dryer, with high vacuum and controlled temperature. Frozen ice sublimes (turns directly to vapor, skipping liquid). Most solvent removed here

Secondary drying (desorption) - gradually heated (still under vacuum) to remove residual solvent by desorption

Good pore interconnectivity

Can be made stronger with **crosslinking**

Cons:

* can take days
* resulting scaffold often soft and weak
* must have a freeze-dryer
* sometimes hard to get uniform pore sizes
