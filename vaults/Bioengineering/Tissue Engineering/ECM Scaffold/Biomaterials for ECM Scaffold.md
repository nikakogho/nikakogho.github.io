Materials for making [[ECM Scaffold]]:
* Natural polymers
  * Allogeneic or xenogeneic
  * Pro: sometimes easy to get
  * Cons
    * Hard to scale
    * Each may differ
    * Immune rejection risk
* Synthetic polymers
  * Pro: can mass manufacture and give custom structural strength
  * Con: can't adapt to changing environment, must manually add [[Integrin|integrin]]-binding parts
* Bioceramics - mostly for [[Bone|bone]] regeneration
* Composite materials - to mix features so we can have rigid structure that is not brittle for instance by mixing ceramics with synthetic polymers (TCP + PGA)

## Common Synthetic Polymers for Scaffold
* Aliphatic [[Polyester|polyesters]] - biodegradable through hydrolysis
* Poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)
* Polyurethanes (PUs)

### Aliphatic Polyesters
Aliphatic - carbons in backbone form open chains

Con: degradation releases acid, may harm body

![PLA_PGA_PLGA.png](pla_pga_plga.png)

Types:

* Polylactic Acid (PLA)
  * [[Lactic Acid]] [[Monomer|monomer]]
  * Hydrophobic
  * Strong, stiff, brittle
  * Degradation releases lactic acid
  * Used in bone, cartilage, sutures, and 3D printing
* Polyglycolic Acid (PGA)
  * [[Glycolic Acid]] monomer
  * Hydrophilic, so degrades faster
  * Crystalline
  * Degradation releases glycolic acid
  * One of the first to be used. Often combined with PLA
* Poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA)
  * ![PLGA.png](plga.png)
  * Co-polymer: lactic acid and glycolic acid monomers chained together
  * **Tunability**: changing lactic acid to glycolic acid ratio changes properties
  * Degradation releases both
  * Used for controlled drug delivery and as scaffold for bone, cartilage, nerves, skin...
* Polycaprolactone (PCL)
  * [[ε-caprolactone]] monomer
  * Hydrophobic and semi-crystalline so degrades very slowly
  * Flexible and tougher than PLA and PGA
  * High biocompatibility
  * Safe degradation
  * Used for long term implants due to slow degradation
  * Used as scaffold for bone, cartilage, tendon, ligament, cardiovascular

### Poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)
[[Polyether]] (monomers linked by [[Ether Bond|ether bonds]])

* [[Ehylene Glycol]] monomer (repeating units of -O-CH₂-CH₂-)
* Hydrophilic
* Bio-inert
  * No bonds
  * No immune reaction
  * No blood clotting
* Crosslinked - many chains bridged to each other to form 3D network called [[Hydrogel]]
* Cell adhesion peptides must be added artificially **before** crosslinking
* Used for drug delivery or as tunable hydrogel to encapsulate cells and tissues

### Polyurethanes (PUs)
Polymers with [[Urethane Linkage|urethane linkages]].
Different monomers.
Can be very soft and elastic or rigid.
Used for catheters, pacemaker leads, parts of artificial hearts, or when good elasticity is needed in tissue engineering

## Common Bioceramics for Scaffold
Mostly [[Calcium]] [[Phosphate|phosphates]] (CaP):
- Hydroxyapatite (HA), formula Ca₁₀(PO₄)₆(OH)
	- Chemically similar to mineral phase of bone
	- High biocompatibility
	- Bioactive (easily bonds with living bone tissue)
	- **Osteoconductive** - osteoblasts (bone cells) attach, grow on and deposit in it easily
	- Not biodegradable
	- Used as coating on metallic implants to fuse with bones or as permanent bone scaffold
- Tricalcium Phosphate (TCP), formula Ca₃(PO₄)₂
	- Forms: alpha-TCP (α-TCP) and beta-TCP (β-TCP)
	- Also biocompatible and osteoconductive
	- Biodegradable over time (months or years)
	- Used for bone void fillers or temporary scaffolds
- Biphasic Calcium Phosphate (BCP)
	- Composite made by combining HA and TCP
	- Best of both worlds depending on ratio
- Bioactive Glasses - specific glass formulations, often based on silica (SiO₂), sodium oxide (Na₂O), calcium oxide (CaO), and phosphorus pentoxide (P₂O₅) – a common one is called Bioglass® 45S5
	- Highly bioactive - forms hydroxycarbonate apatite (HCA) layer
		- Similar to bone minerals
		- Bonds strongly and rapidly to bone tissue
	- Sometimes **osteoinductive** - release ions to stimulate bone cells to be more active
		- Can also stimulate mesenchymal [[Stem Cells|stem cells]] to become bone cells
	- Mostly resorbable
	- Used as bone void fillers, coatings for implants, or parts in composite scaffolds
