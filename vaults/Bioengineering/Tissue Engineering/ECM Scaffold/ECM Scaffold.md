Artificial placeholder for [[Extracellular Matrix]] used in [[Tissue Engineering]]

Purposes:
* Mechanical support
* Porosity (interconnected) to allow nutrient flow, cell infiltration and waste removal
* 3D shape template
* Guides cell behavior through chemoattractants and repellents

## [[Biomaterials for ECM Scaffold]]
- Natural polymers
- Synthetic polymers
- Bioceramics
- Composite materials

## [[ECM Scaffold Fabrication]]
Has different methods because:
1) different biomaterials have different needs
2) some need large scale vs others need fine grained details
3) some cheap ways are sometimes ok other times we need expensive ways
