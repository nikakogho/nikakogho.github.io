Cellular 3D printing.
Part of [[ECM Scaffold Fabrication]].
Additive manufacturing.

Unlike [[ECM Scaffold Acellular 3D Printing]], bioprinting used [[Bio-Ink]], type of ink that includes cells and [[Cell Signaling|signaling]] molecules.

## Inkjet
One dot at a time, good if low viscosity

## Extrusion
Like normal filament printing in consumer grade 3D printers.
Shear stress may rupture cells.
Low resolution

## Laser-Assisted Bioprinting
With lasers, avoids nozzles, safer but slower
