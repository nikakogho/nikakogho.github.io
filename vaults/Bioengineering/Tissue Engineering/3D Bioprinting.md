For [[ECM Scaffold Fabrication]].
Part of [[Tissue Engineering]].

Unlike conventional methods that work by removing (like with sculpting), this is additive manufacturing, building from ground up (well except we might also add support structures that we later remove but it's still mostly additive).

Often uses **bioink** (made of cells)

## Stereolithography (SLA)
Shines laser-accurate light on **photopolymer** (light-reactive, mostly UV) resin and solidifies it layer by layer.

Often for [[Bone]], [[Cartilage]].

### Steps
1. Build platform submerged in liquid vat of resin
2. Light curing - UV laser or digital light projector (DLP) projects on specific parts of current layer to solidify it
3. Platform moves down by fixed height (platform height) so next liquid layer flows on top of solidified layer
4. Repeat until done
5. Post-Processing
	1. Removed from vat
	2. Washed
	3. Post-cured in oven to completely solidify
	4. Support structures (if used for overhanging parts) removed

### Used For
- Specially designed biodegradable photopolymers like
	- poly(propylene fumarate) (PPF)
	- modified polycaprolactone (PCL)
	- polyethylene glycol (PEG)
- Sometimes in ceramic resins but more complex process here

### Cons
- Cytotoxic - can kill cells (mitigated by using biofriendly materials so that this liquid resin can become bioink filled with cells)
- Only works with photopolymers and that means not for many tissues
- Removing support structures can sometimes damage it
- Some resin layers have problem with light properly penetrating and solidifying all parts
