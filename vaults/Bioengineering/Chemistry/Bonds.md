Attractive forces holding atoms in molecule together.

Types:

* Ionic - cations mixing with anions
* Covalent - 2 atoms share electrons equally, held by attraction between nuclei and electrons
  * Polar bonds - when electrons are <b>NOT</b> shared equally
  * Sigma bonds - head-to-head overlap (first bond, so only bond in single bonds)
  * Pi bonds - parallel overlap of p orbitals (second bond) ![Pasted\_image\_20241110172644.png](pasted_image_20241110172644.png)
* Metallic - \[\[Metal|metal]] ions in metallic solid surrounded by freely moving sea of electrons
* Hydrogen - between hydrogen and highly electronegative atoms, weak
* Van der Waals interactions - in non-polar molecules, temporary fluctuations in electron distribution create weak attractive forces
