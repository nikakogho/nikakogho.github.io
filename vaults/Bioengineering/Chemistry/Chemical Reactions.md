Main types are:
- Combination (synthesis) - 2+ substances combine into 1
	- Addition - similar small molecules combine into bigger one
- Decomposition - 1 substance breaks down into 2+
- Displacement (Single Displacement) - element in compound replaced by another element
- Acid-Base (Neutralization) - [[Acid]] reacts with a [[Base|base]] to form [[Salt|salt]] and [[Water|water]]
- [[Redox Reaction|Oxidation-Reduction (Redox)]] - one substance is oxidized (loses electrons) and another is reduced (gains electrons)
- [[Precipitation]] - 2+ aqueous substances react and form insoluble solid (precipitate)
- Combustion - substance reacts with [[Oxygen]] and produces heat and light
- Substitution - functional group in molecule replaced with another functional group
- Elimination - removal of atoms from molecule to form a double bond
