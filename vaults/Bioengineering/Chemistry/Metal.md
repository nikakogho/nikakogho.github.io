Typically dense, solid, reflective materials with high melting and boiling point.
Most common are copper, aluminum, gold, silver, iron, lead.

## General Properties
- High electrical conductivity
	- Metal ions in solid metal are surrounded by a freely moving sea of electrons
- High thermal conductivity
- Reflective
- Ductile and malleable - bend without breaking
- High tensile strength - resist being pulled apart
- Soluble - forms metal ions

## Types
- Alkali metals - first column of [[Periodic Table]], highly reactive and low melting/boiling points
	- Lithium (Li)
	- Sodium (Na)
	- Potassium (K)
	- Rubidium (Rb)
	- Cesium (Cs)
	- Francium (Fr)
- Alkaline earth metals - second column of periodic table, less reactive than alkali but reactive
	- Beryllium (Be)
	- Magnesium (Mg)
	- Calcium (Ca)
	- Strontium (Sr)
	- Barium (Ba)
	- Radium (Ra)
- Transition metals - d-block of periodic table, unique electron configuration giving high melting and boiling point, high density, can form complex chemical compounds
	- Iron (Fe)
	- Copper (Cu)
	- Gold (Au)
	- Silver (Ag)
	- Platinum group metals - high purity, used in catalysts and electronic devices
		- Platinum (Pt)
		- Palladium (Pd)
		- Rhodium (Rh)
		- Iridium (Ir)
		- Osmium (Os)
		- Ruthenium (Ru)
- Rare earth metals - f-block of periodic table, used in electronics, magnets, ceramics
	- Cerium (Ce)
	- Dysprosium (Dy)
	- Erbium (Er)
	- Europium (Eu)
	- Ytterbium (Yb)
	- ...
- Post-transition metals - p-block of periodic table, lower melting and boiling point and less dense than transition metals
	- Aluminum (Al)
	- Zinc (Zn)
	- Tin (Sn)
	- Lead (Pb)
- Noble metals - highly unreactive, resistant to corrosion. Used in jewels and coins, also electronic stuff and chemicals for their stability and resistance to corrosion
	- Gold (Au)
	- Silver (Ag)
	- Platinum (Pt)
