PV = nRT

P - Pressure
V - Volume
n - number of moles
**R** - **Universal Gas Constant** = 8.3145 L kpa / K mol
T - temperature

Relevant unless under high pressure or low temperature, then refer to [[Van der Waals Equation]] for real gases.

## Boyle's Law
if n, T = constant -> $$ PV = nRT = k $$

## Charlie's Law
if n, P = constant -> $$ \frac{V}{T} = \frac{nR}{P} = b $$
## Avogadro's Law
if T, P = constant
$$ \frac{V}{n} = \frac{RT}{P} = a $$
