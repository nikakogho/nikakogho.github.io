AKA Haber-Bosch Process

Industrial process of making ammonia (NH3) from [[Nitrogen]] gas (N2) + [[Hydrogen]] gas (H2).
Used for fertilizers and ammo.
Used to make nitric acid (HNO3), urea (NH2CONH2), ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3).

Developed by German Fritz Haber in 1913, used a lot in World War 1.

## How
Heated at 450-500Â°C, at a high pressure of 150-300 atmospheres, with catalysts (mostly iron-based). Reaction releases heat (<i>exothermic</i>), so cooling is needed.

**N2 + 3H2 -> 2NH3**
