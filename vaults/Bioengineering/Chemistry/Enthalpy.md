Total energy of a system defined as internal energy (E) + energy needed to change its volume to external pressure (PV).

Amount of heat needed to adjust temperature at constant pressure.

**H = E + PV**

H - enthalpy
E - energy
P - pressure
V - volume

**ΔH** is change in total energy.

if ΔH > 0 then reaction **endothermic** (energy gets absorbed).
if ΔH < 0 then reaction is **exothermic** (energy released).

**ΔH = q + w + Δ(PV)**
q - heat
w - work

if **pressure is constant** then **ΔH = q + w + PΔV**

w = -PΔV
ΔH = q - PΔV + PΔV
**ΔH = q**

## Hess's Law
Total change in ethalpy = sum of changes in each reaction
