## Negative autoregulation

Self-arrow is a regressor => "you've made too much, stop"
X<sub>st</sub> = K (steady state means productions = removal, AKA **fixed point**)
T<sub>response</sub> = T<sub>1/2</sub> = K / 2β

Negative Auto Regulation (NAR) production and removal vs simple production and removal

Robust to changes in β and α, that's good for making synthetic circuits
