Protein that controls which parts of DNA get transcripted and at what rate, based on environmental signals like "hungry", "danger", "must repair DNA", etc.

Binds somewhere in [[Promoter|promoter]] to affect transcription rate by changing probability/time of RNA<sub>p</sub> binding to promoter.

*Activator* increases rate
*Repressor* decreases rate

Activaror = X → Y
Repressor = X ⟞ Y

A gene is activated by some factors and repressed by others
