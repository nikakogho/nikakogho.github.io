A denoising model for [[Image Generation]] that starts with an image of random values and step by step refines it

Sort like a cell going totipotent -> pluripotent -> multipotent -> specialized

At each step, a noisy image is received and a less noisy version is returned

[[Neural Network]] used by stable diffusion is [[U-Net]], which uses [[ResNet#ResidualBlock|residual blocks]]
