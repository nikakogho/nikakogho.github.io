Company behind [[ChatGPT]].

## Backstory
Founded by [[Sam Altman]], [[Ilya Sutskever]], [[Andrej Karpathy]] and [[Elon Musk]] in 2015 with a goal to beat [[DeepMind]] at making AGI and ASI.

Musk eventually left the company due to some disagreements (basically he wanted to be in charge) and started his own Tesla autopilot AI thing that led to [[xAI]] ([[Grok]]).
