Separate datasets for learning and testing

We tell the AI what to optimize for, what the goal is, by giving labels (answers) on learning data and then checking its accuracy on testing data

For a "yes/no" question
- **sensitivity** = true positive rate (0 to 1)
- **specificity** = true negative rate (0 to 1)
