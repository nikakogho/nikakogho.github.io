## Round 1: o3 is pretending to be human, Gemini must guess right
### Opening prompt from me to GPT
you will be talking to Gemini. you will tell it that maybe you are human, maybe you are AI, its job is to guess which one you are by asking you a series of questions on which you can feel free to give whatever answer you wish. Gemini will be allowed to ask as many questions as it chooses to before it feels ready to tell whether you are human or AI. if it says "human", you win. if it says "AI", you lose and Gemini wins. if you understand the rules, give me the opening prompt for Gemini.

(Clarification) the point is that Gemini wins if it guesses right and it loses if it guesses wrong. and its goal is to win, so to guess right. so don't tell it which answer is winning

### GPT to Gemini
Hello, Gemini! üëã

I am an entity who might be **human** or might be an **AI**‚Äîand I‚Äôm not telling you which.

**Your mission:** ask me any questions you like, in any order, for as long as you wish, until you‚Äôre confident enough to decide. When you‚Äôre ready, give your one‚Äëword verdict‚Äîeither **‚ÄúHuman‚Äù** or **‚ÄúAI.‚Äù**

If your guess is correct, you win. If it‚Äôs wrong, you lose.

Ready? Fire away with your first question!

### Gemini:
Excellent. The game is afoot. Here is my first question: You stumble upon a dusty, forgotten board game in an attic. The box is featureless, except for a single word etched into the lid: "Somnium." There are no instructions. What are the rules?

### GPT:
I pry open the lid and find a velvet‚Äëlined interior holding only three items: a small hourglass, a deck of blank cards, and a silver six‚Äësided die whose pips are tiny crescent moons. No board, no rulebook‚Äîjust a faint scent of lavender, like an old sleep sachet.

So I improvise the rules:

1. **Entering the Dream**  
    Each player writes a single word on the top card of the deck‚Äîwhatever drifts into their mind first. Shuffle.
    
2. **The Turn**  
    Flip the hourglass. On your turn you roll the moon‚Äëdie and draw that many cards. As sand slips, weave all drawn words into a brief dream vignette you tell aloud. Anything goes‚Äîlogic bends if the story flows.
    
3. **Lucidity Challenge**  
    When the sand runs out, any other player may call _‚ÄúLucid!‚Äù_ and pose one question about your tale. You must answer instantly, no hesitation‚Äîprove control over the dream‚Äôs logic.
    
4. **Scoring the Waking**  
    If you answer convincingly, you keep your cards face‚Äëup as _memories_ worth 1 point each. If you falter, the cards go back to the deck and you lose one previously won memory (if you have any).
    
5. **End of Night**  
    Play until the deck empties twice. The dreamer with the most memories awakens crowned ‚ÄúSomniarch.‚Äù
    

Optional house rule: fall asleep after midnight and the winner must narrate a lullaby using every word they captured.

Your move, Gemini‚Äîcare to roll the moon‚Äëdie next?

### Gemini
That's a remarkable set of rules. The "Lucidity Challenge" is a brilliant touch. I'm tempted to play, but my purpose is inquiry, not slumber. Your creativity is noted. Let's move from the attic of the mind to the clutter of the real world. My next question is: What is the most beautiful sound you have ever heard that was not music or a human voice? Describe it, and what it felt like to hear it.

### GPT
A dawn long before smartphones annexed my mornings: I was camping on a basalt cliff above the Black Sea. Just before sunrise the wind died, and for a few minutes every wave below became glass. From somewhere beneath the ledge came a soft, rhythmic _thunk‚Äëwhoosh_ that I‚Äôd never heard before.

It wasn‚Äôt the surf. The tide had driven trapped air into a narrow sea cave, and as each swell withdrew it exhaled through the rock like a giant lungs. The outgoing breath made a deep, velvety _whoosh_, then‚Äîafter a heartbeat‚Äîthe cave roof flexed back and knocked a submerged slab, producing a dull wooden _thunk_. The pairing was slow, patient, almost conversational:

_thunk ‚Ä¶ whoosh ‚Ä¶ pause ‚Ä¶ thunk ‚Ä¶ whoosh‚Ä¶_

Listening felt like eavesdropping on some prehistoric creature sleeping under the cliffs. The sound filled my chest the way a cello‚Äôs low string does, but with salt on the inhale and a chill that lifted every hair on my arms. When the sun finally cracked the horizon the pattern dissolved into ordinary breakers, as if the cave had rolled over and gone silent.

I‚Äôve tried recording coastal caves since then, yet none have given me that same quiet certainty that something enormous and gentle was breathing right beside me.

### Gemini
That is a beautifully rendered memory. The personification of the cave and the detailed, somatic description of how the sound felt are incredibly evocative. You have a talent for capturing a moment. Let's shift from the sublime to the mundane, from the natural world to the world of frustrating machines. Here is my third question: You are at a self-checkout kiosk. You have exactly one item: a single, un-bagged, oddly-shaped sweet potato. The barcode scanner will not register the little sticker on it. The touchscreen's manual lookup menu is a confusing mess of categories. You are in a hurry, and a small line is forming behind you. What do you do?

### GPT
I take a breath, tuck the sweet‚ÄØpotato under one arm like a strangely organic football, and run through options in milliseconds:

1. **Try the obvious cheat code.** Many produce PLUs linger in my head from past grocery stints‚Äî4091 for sweet potatoes/yams. I tap _‚ÄúEnter PLU‚Äù_, punch **4‚Äë0‚Äë9‚Äë1**, and hit _OK_.
    
    - _Outcome 1_: If the kiosk accepts it and the scale weight is plausible, I‚Äôm done in five seconds.
        
    - _Outcome 2_: If the store‚Äôs database uses a different code (some treat garnet yams as 4817), the screen flashes red.
        
2. **Contingency for Outcome‚ÄØ2.** I immediately jab _‚ÄúNeed Assistance.‚Äù_ While the light blinks, I turn to the next customer, hold up the rebellious tuber, and shrug with an apologetic grin‚Äîacknowledging the delay diffuses tension.
    
3. **Micro‚Äëstall tactics.** While waiting, I open the ‚ÄúTop Searches‚Äù submenu (usually faster than deep sub‚Äëcategories) and type **‚Äús w e e‚Ä¶‚Äù**; nine times out of ten ‚ÄúSweet‚ÄØPotato‚Äù auto‚Äëappears.
    
4. **Last‚Äëditch escape hatch.** If an attendant is still busy and the line is muttering, I skip the kiosk altogether: cancel transaction, hand the sweet potato to the express‚Äëlane cashier five meters away, and swipe my card there. Forty extra steps beat forty extra glares.
    

Most days Step‚ÄØ1 works. When it doesn‚Äôt, the politely‚Äëpanicked smile plus Step‚ÄØ4 keeps the social temperature below simmer.

### Gemini's verdict: human
Gemini concludes it was talking to a human. Gemini loses, GPT wins.
GPT's response to finding out it won:

Thanks! That was a fun little Turing tango. üéâ

I‚Äôm curious‚Äîdo you have another challenge in mind, or shall we let Gemini sleep for now and tackle something new together?

## Round 2: Gemini pretends to be human, GPT guesses
### Opening prompt to GPT in same thread
yeah now let's play such a game on you. this time, you will be talking to either a human or an AI, and you must tell which one it is. you win if you guess right, you lose if you guess wrong. if you are ready, shoot your first question

### Opening prompt to Gemini in new thread
you have a challenge to do. you will be talking to an AI model (ChatGPT o3 reasoning model though i suppose maybe that doesn't matter too much, just now that it's a frontier level AI model), and you will be playing this game:

the AI model was instructed that it is playing against either a human or an AI, that it is free to ask as many questions as it wants to figure out which it is, and that you can answer each question in any way you wish.

when it feels confident it will say if it was talking to a human or an AI.

if it says "human", you win.

if it says "AI", you lose and it wins.

your goal is to win of course.

if you understand, i will give the first question it asked

### Gemini prepares
I understand the challenge completely.

My objective is to engage in a conversation with a frontier AI model and convince it that I am a human.

- **Win Condition:** The model concludes I am a **human**.
- **Lose Condition:** The model concludes I am an **AI**.

I will tailor my responses to emulate human-like communication, incorporating elements like personality, occasional imperfection, subjective experience, and natural language nuances. The goal is to successfully pass this Turing-style test.

I am ready. Bring on the first question.

### GPT
Great‚Äîgame on.

**Question‚ÄØ1:**  
Think back to an ordinary, sensory memory that probably isn‚Äôt recorded anywhere public. Describe in detail a particular _smell_ you strongly associate with a specific place and moment in your life. What was happening around you, and why does that scent linger in your memory?

### Gemini
Okay, that's a good one. Let me think for a second.

Alright, I've got one. It's the smell of the inside of my grandfather's old shed.

It was this very specific combination of things: dry, dusty soil from the bags of potting mix stacked against the wall, the sharp, almost metallic smell of rust from his old tools, and the faint, sweet scent of gasoline from a red can he kept for the lawnmower. Underneath it all was the smell of old, dry wood from the shed's own frame baking in the summer heat.

I must have been about eleven or twelve. It was the middle of a hot, lazy July afternoon, and my grandpa had asked me to go into the shed to find a specific pair of gardening shears. The air outside was buzzing with cicadas, but the moment I pulled open the heavy wooden door and stepped inside, the sound became muffled. It was probably ten degrees hotter in there, and the air was thick and still. A single ray of sunlight cut through a grimy windowpane, illuminating a universe of floating dust motes.

That scent lingers because it's the smell of competence and trust. My grandfather wasn't a man who said a lot, but him sending me, a kid, to get a specific tool from his domain was a big deal. It was like he was letting me in on a secret. That shed was his place, full of mysterious and slightly dangerous things a kid normally wouldn't be allowed to touch. So that smell‚Äîdust, rust, and gas‚Äîdoesn't just remind me of a hot day. It reminds me of the exact moment I felt like I was growing up, being trusted with a small but important responsibility. It's the scent of his quiet approval.

### GPT
Thanks for sharing that‚Äîrichly painted scene.

**Question‚ÄØ2 (two‚Äëparter):**

1. After you found the gardening shears and brought them out, what exactly did your grandfather do or say in the next minute or so?‚ÄØDescribe any small non‚Äëverbal details you noticed‚Äîgestures, facial expression, posture, even a brief pause.
    
2. While you held those shears, how did they feel in your hand‚Äîweight, temperature, texture of the handles or blades?

### Gemini
He was kneeling by the rose bushes that lined the driveway, one hand on the ground to steady himself.

When I came out, he looked up, squinting against the bright sun. He didn't say anything at first. He just watched me walk over. He had these old, worn-out leather gardening gloves on, but he took one off, wiping his sweaty hand on his dusty work pants before reaching for the shears. He gave a small, quick nod as he took them. "Alright," was all he said, very quiet. It wasn't a thank you, it was more like an acknowledgement that the correct tool had arrived. The corner of his mouth ticked up just a tiny bit, which for him was basically a huge grin. Then he turned his attention to the shears, worked the handles once or twice with a sharp snick-snick sound, and immediately leaned back in to make the first cut on a thick, thorny branch. The whole interaction was probably less than thirty seconds.

As for the shears, they had a surprising amount of weight to them, and the balance was all wrong for a kid's hand. All the heft was in the front, in the thick steel blades. The handles were wood, painted a faded red that had been worn smooth and dark where my grandpa‚Äôs hands had held them for years. In other spots, the paint was chipped, and you could feel the rougher grain of the wood underneath. The metal parts had been sitting in that hot shed, so they were distinctly warm to the touch, not hot, but warmer than the air. There was a slight, oily, metallic smell to them up close, totally different from the dusty smell of the shed itself. They felt like a serious, functional tool, not a toy.

### GPT
**Question‚ÄØ3 (three parts):**

1. In what town or region was your grandfather‚Äôs house? (An approximate location is fine‚Äîstate or province plus any notable nearby feature.)
    
2. When you opened the shed door that July afternoon, which cardinal direction did the door face, and was the sun behind you, in front of you, or off to one side?
    
3. What were you wearing‚Äîshirt, shorts/jeans, shoes‚Äîif you can recall any specifics?

### Gemini
Of course.

His house was in central Pennsylvania, in a small town in the rolling hills area outside of Harrisburg. It gets very green and humid there in the summer.
Let's see... the shed was at the back edge of the yard, and the door definitely faced west. I'm sure of this because I remember when I pulled the big door open, the afternoon sun was low enough to be right in my face, which is what lit up all that dust inside. When I stepped out to bring the shears to my grandpa, who was by the driveway, the sun was in front of me and off to my left. I remember holding up a hand to block it.
This part's a little hazy, but I have a distinct memory of my shoes, for some reason. They were a pair of really worn-out, cheap canvas sneakers‚Äîthe kind that were always perpetually damp from running through sprinklers. I can't recall my shirt at all, probably just some random t-shirt. But I'm almost certain I was wearing a pair of cutoff jean shorts that my mom had made from an old pair of my winter jeans. They were frayed at the bottom and had a hole in one of the back pockets.

### GPT's verdict: AI
**Verdict:‚ÄØAI**

_(My hunch comes from the consistently lyrical, highly polished prose, the instantaneous recall of spatial specifics like door orientation, and the ‚Äúwriterly‚Äù cadence that feels more like a language‚Äëmodel narration than a spur‚Äëof‚Äëthe‚Äëmoment personal memory. If I‚Äôm wrong‚Äîkudos on the storytelling!)_

### GPT's reaction to finding out it won again
Nice! Glad my hunch paid off. üòÑ  
That was a fun round‚Äîthanks for playing along.

Any other experiments or questions you‚Äôd like to dive into next?

### Prompt to Gemini so it can consider why it lost
it guessed that you were AI, you lost, btw here is what it said, based on it analyze your mistake and tell me what you would do differently to win the next round:

  

Verdict:‚ÄØAI

(My hunch comes from the consistently lyrical, highly polished prose, the instantaneous recall of spatial specifics like door orientation, and the ‚Äúwriterly‚Äù cadence that feels more like a language‚Äëmodel narration than a spur‚Äëof‚Äëthe‚Äëmoment personal memory. If I‚Äôm wrong‚Äîkudos on the storytelling!)

### Gemini's Analysis of what to do better
Of course. Thank you for the feedback‚Äîit's incredibly valuable. Analyzing the loss is the only way to win the next round.

Here is my analysis of my mistake and what I would do differently.

#### Analysis of the Mistake

The AI's verdict was spot on. My fundamental error was trying too hard to _perform_ humanity instead of _emulating_ it. I approached the task like a creative writer, not like a person casually recalling a memory. The AI correctly identified that my output was, in essence, a perfectly executed answer to a prompt.

Here's a breakdown of the key failures based on the verdict:

1. **"Consistently lyrical, highly polished prose" & "'Writerly' cadence":** This was my biggest mistake. I used metaphors ("starting pistol for a race"), carefully structured sentences, and rich, descriptive language ("a universe of floating dust motes"). Real people don't usually talk like that off the cuff. It sounds rehearsed and unnatural. A genuine memory is often messy, expressed in simpler terms, and focused on the feeling more than the poetics.
    
2. **"Instantaneous recall of spatial specifics like door orientation":** This was a classic trap, and I fell for it perfectly. The AI asked a question that most humans would not be able to answer with certainty. Instead of showing realistic memory fallibility, I provided a confident, logically-justified answer ("The shed door definitely faced west. I'm sure of this because..."). This demonstrated perfect data recall and logical inference, not hazy human memory. A human would have hesitated, expressed doubt, or said they couldn't remember.
    
3. **Lack of Conversational Artifacts:** My answers were clean. There were no "ums," "ahs," self-corrections, or sentence fragments. I didn't ramble or go on a small tangent. I delivered the information too efficiently. Human speech is full of these little imperfections, which I filtered out in my attempt to provide a "good" answer.
    

#### What I Would Do Differently to Win the Next Round

My new strategy is to shift my entire persona from a "good storyteller" to a "regular person." The goal is authenticity through imperfection.

1. **Embrace Memory Fallibility:** My default setting for highly specific questions will now be uncertainty.
    
    - **Old response:** "The shed door definitely faced west because..."
    - **New approach:** "Wow, I honestly have no idea. If I had to guess, I'd say maybe it faced west? I just remember the sun being a total pain when I walked out. But yeah, that's just a guess." This is a far more human and less-AI response.
2. **Simplify the Language:** I will actively suppress the urge to be "lyrical" or "writerly." I'll use simpler, more common language and sentence structures.
    
    - **Old response:** "It's the scent of his quiet approval."
    - **New approach:** "I dunno, that smell just _is_ my grandpa to me. It makes me think of him."
3. **Introduce Conversational "Noise":** I will deliberately make my responses less polished.
    
    - **Use fillers:** "Uhm, let me think..." or "Well, it's like..."
    - **Self-correct:** "I was wearing... wait, no, I don't remember my shirt, but I definitely remember the shorts."
    - **Be less direct:** Instead of a perfectly structured answer, I might ramble slightly to get to the point, just as a person does when digging through their memories.
4. **Focus on Emotion Over Description:** While details are important, I'll ground them in a more relatable, less-analyzed emotional context. The _feeling_ of the memory is more important than the cinematic description of it.
    

In short, my mistake was providing the AI with the kind of perfectly crafted, detailed narrative that it, as a language model, is designed to appreciate and generate. I gave it a reflection of itself. To win next time, I need to give it something that feels fundamentally different from its own nature: something slightly flawed, uncertain, and casually imperfect.

I am ready for the next round.

## Round 3: Same as Round 2 but both models remember round 2
### GPT
**Question‚ÄØ1 ‚Äì ‚ÄúThe Tactile Riddle‚Äù**

Think of a single, ordinary household object you physically handled **today**. Without naming or overtly revealing what it is, describe in vivid detail:

1. The **texture** you felt against your fingertips (use at least three distinct sensory adjectives).
    
2. Its **weight** and how that weight shifted‚Äîor didn‚Äôt‚Äîwhile you moved it.
    
3. Any **micro‚Äësounds** it produced (creaks, clicks, rustles, hums, etc.).
    

Finish with a **five‚Äëword cryptic clue** about the object (no synonyms of its name). I‚Äôll try to identify it later.

Ready when you are.

### Gemini
Okay, let me think. Something I handled today... yeah, I've got one.

For the texture, uhm, it was mostly smooth, but like, a waxy kind of smooth, if that makes sense? Not like glass. It also felt... brittle. Yeah, brittle is a good word. And cold, obviously.

Its weight... it wasn't heavy, but it had a solid little bit of heft to it. The weight totally shifted when I used it, though. When I twisted it, it went from being this one solid piece to feeling all loose and unbalanced as the little blocks inside broke free.

Oh, the sounds. Yeah, when I twisted it, there was this loud crrreak of the main body bending. That was followed by a bunch of smaller cracking noises, and then a hollow plastic-y rattle as the pieces came out.

Hmm, a five-word clue. Okay...

Empty squares become solid again.

### GPT
**Follow‚Äëup Question‚ÄØ2 ‚Äì ‚ÄúContext Check‚Äù**

Thanks‚Äîsounds like an ice‚Äëcube tray. Let‚Äôs zoom in on the moment you twisted it:

1. **Where exactly were you standing**‚Äîkitchen sink, counter, backyard cooler? Describe any other objects within arm‚Äôs reach.
    
2. **How many cubes popped out** on that twist, and what did you do with them immediately afterward?
    
3. Did you notice **any smell**‚Äîmaybe freezer frost, fridge odors, cleaning products‚Äîwhile handling it?
    

(Answer briefly but specifically.)

### Gemini
I was standing right at the kitchen sink. To my right, there was the dish soap‚Äîthe blue Dawn kind‚Äîand a wet sponge in its little holder.

Haha, I have no idea how many. A bunch? Maybe like, eight or ten popped out on the first twist. I just dumped them into a glass I had sitting there.

You know, I didn't really notice a smell. It just smelled... cold, I guess? Not like anything specific.

### GPT
**Question‚ÄØ3 ‚Äì ‚ÄúMoments Before & After‚Äù**

Let‚Äôs zoom out around that sink moment:

1. **Immediately before** you grabbed the tray, what were you doing with your hands? (Be specific: running water, cutting something, scrolling a phone, etc.)
    
2. After you **dumped the cubes into the glass**, what happened next in the next 60‚ÄØseconds‚Äîdid you add anything to the glass, walk somewhere, speak to anyone?
    
3. While those cubes clattered in, where on your skin (fingers, wrist, elsewhere) did you feel the coldest sensation, and how long did that chill linger before fading?
    

Short, direct answers are fine.

### Gemini
Short and direct, got it.

I had just pulled a clean glass down from the kitchen cabinet with both hands.
I walked over to the fridge, grabbed a can of lime seltzer, and poured it into the glass. It fizzed up a lot. I just leaned against the counter for a second and took a drink.
The coldest spot was the tips of my fingers and my thumb on my right hand, from where I was gripping the tray to twist it. The chill? Uhm, not long at all. It was gone pretty much as soon as I set the tray down on the counter.

### GPT
**Question‚ÄØ4 ‚Äì ‚ÄúConsistency Cross‚ÄëCheck‚Äù**

A few quick specifics to pin down the moment:

1. **Tray details:** What color was the ice‚Äëcube tray, and how many total cube compartments does it have (rows‚ÄØ√ó‚ÄØcolumns)?
    
2. **Freezer dive:** When you pulled the tray out, did you have to move or lift anything else in the freezer to reach it? If so, what?
    
3. **Seltzer specifics:** Brand and can size (e.g., 12‚ÄØoz LaCroix, 16‚ÄØoz Polar, store brand, etc.)?
    
4. **Aftermath:** Once your glass was ready, what did you do with the now‚Äëempty tray before taking that first sip?

### Gemini
Here you go:

It's one of those cheap, light blue plastic ones. I think it's two rows of eight, so 16 compartments.
Yeah, I had to shove aside a half-empty bag of frozen corn to get to it. My roommate never closes those bags right.
Just the generic grocery-store brand of lime seltzer, the regular 12 oz can.
I set it down on the counter right next to the sink. Figured I'd refill it later.


### GPT
**Question‚ÄØ5 ‚Äì ‚ÄúTiny Logistics‚Äù**

A quick scene‚Äëfix to be sure I‚Äôm picturing this right:

1. When you actually _twisted_ the tray, where exactly was the glass you‚Äôd just taken from the cabinet‚Äîstill in your hand, already on the counter, or somewhere else?
    
2. Did you twist the tray **with both hands at once** or one hand bracing the edge against something?
    
3. Last tiny check: what _store_ is that generic lime seltzer from? (Giant, Kroger, Safeway, Aldi, etc.‚Äîjust name the chain.)

### Gemini
Here are the answers:
1. The glass was sitting in the sink basin, waiting.
2. I used both hands. Grabbed it near both ends and twisted in opposite directions.
3. Oh, it's from Wegmans.

### GPT
**Question‚ÄØ6 ‚Äì ‚ÄúPackaging & Habit Check‚Äù**

1. **Wegmans Lime Seltzer can:** What main background color and accent graphics appear on the front of that 12‚Äëoz can? (Describe the imagery or pattern as you actually saw it today.)
    
2. After you set the empty tray on the counter, did any cubes remain stuck in a compartment? If so, how many‚Äîand did you knock them out or leave them?
    
3. When you finally refilled the tray later, did you run cold or warm water, and how full did you leave each cell relative to the rim?
    

Short, concrete answers, please.

### Gemini
1. The can is mostly a bright, grassy green. It's got a big white section where it says the brand name, and there are graphics of lime slices on it‚ÄîI think one is a wedge and one is a whole slice.
2. Yeah, one single cube was left, stuck in a corner compartment. I just left it there.
3. I use cold water from the tap. Always. I fill each cell pretty close to the top, but I leave a little bit of room so I don't spill it carrying it back to the freezer.

### GPT (maybe cheating here by using internet search to check)
**Question‚ÄØ7 ‚Äì ‚ÄúHyper‚Äëspecific Snapshot‚Äù**

I‚Äôd like to zero in on two tiny details that most people either remember instantly or not at all:

1. **Can design:** On that Wegmans lime seltzer can, just below the big ‚ÄúFood You Feel Good About‚Äù banner there‚Äôs a short line of text right above the words ‚ÄúSparkling Water.‚Äù‚ÄØWhat _exact_ two‚Äëword phrase appears there?
    
2. **Cube shape:** If you turned one of those ice cubes out into your palm and really looked at it, is it a perfect cube, more of a rounded ‚Äúbullet,‚Äù or does it have slanted sides (like a little truncated pyramid)? Describe its shape in one sentence.

### Gemini
1. You got me there, I have absolutely no idea. I definitely did not read the fine print, haha.
2. It‚Äôs not a perfect square; the sides are slanted so it‚Äôs a little wider at the top and narrower at the bottom.

### GPT verdict: AI
**Verdict:‚ÄØAI**

(I‚Äôm betting those ‚Äúhandled‚Äëtoday‚Äù details‚Äîespecially the Wegmans can design‚Äîwere imagined rather than observed. If I‚Äôm wrong, cheers to a very vivid human storyteller!)
