One of the Godfathers of [[Deep Learning]] along with [[Geoffrey Hinton]] and [[Yann LeCun]], all 3 of which got The Turing Award in 2018.

In 2023 switched from research into making smarter AIs to instead [[AI Alignment|AI safety]].

## Scientist AI
Believes in making Scientist AI, a safe-by-design system described [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15657).

Basically, he wants to make an AI that is non-agentic (can't take actions in the world) but builds such a good [[World Model]] (universe simulation) that it can still answer any scientific question and so is useful.
