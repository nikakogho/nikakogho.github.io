Thinking about other people's thoughts/beliefs/perspectives

Involves **temporoparietal junction (TPJ)**

TPJ is also involved in attention reorienting

TPJ ties together input from other areas:
- [[Amygdala]] for emotions
- [[Posterior Superior Temporal Sulcus (pSTS)]] for social context
- Medial [[Prefrontal Cortex]] (mPFC) to infer traits and intentions like "he's good", "she's evil"
- [[Precuneus]] / Posterior [[Cingulate cortex]] (PCC) for self-referential thinking and memory, for perspective-taking

Can help figure out if someone is really ok when they say "I'm fine"

TPJ not working right may cause **autism**
