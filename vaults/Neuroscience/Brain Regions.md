# Major Brain Regions

The brain is incredibly complex, often divided into major regions for study.

## Cerebrum

The largest part, responsible for higher functions like thought and action. It's divided into four lobes:
1.  **Frontal Lobe:** Planning, decision-making, [[Working Memory]].
2.  **Parietal Lobe:** Processing sensory information (touch, temperature, pain).
3.  **Temporal Lobe:** Auditory processing, memory ([[Types of Memory]]).
4.  **Occipital Lobe:** Visual processing.

## Cerebellum

Located at the back, coordinates voluntary movements like posture, balance, coordination, and speech. Damage here can lead to ataxia.

## Brainstem

Connects the cerebrum and cerebellum to the spinal cord. Controls vital functions like breathing, heart rate, sleep, and wakefulness.
