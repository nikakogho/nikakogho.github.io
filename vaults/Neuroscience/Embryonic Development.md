Part of ectoderm called **neuroectoderm** turns into **neural tube** through **neurulation**

Neural tube will form \[\[Central Nervous System]] and neural crest will form \[\[Peripheral Nervous System]]

## Neural tube into brain

Splits into forebrain (\[\[Telencephalon]] + \[\[Diencephalon]]), \[\[Midbrain]] and \[\[Hindbrain]]

Diencephalon becomes \[\[Thalamus]] and \[\[Hypothalamus]]

Telencephalon becomes cerebral cortex, \[\[Basal Ganglia]] and \[\[Amygdala]]

Telencephalon splits into hemispheres
