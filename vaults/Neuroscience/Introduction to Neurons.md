# Introduction to Neurons

Neurons are the fundamental units of the brain and nervous system. They are responsible for receiving sensory input, sending motor commands, and transforming/relaying electrical signals.

## Basic Structure

A typical neuron consists of:
* **Soma (Cell Body):** Contains the nucleus and organelles.
* **Dendrites:** Branch-like structures that receive signals.
* **Axon:** A long projection that transmits signals away from the soma.
* **Axon Terminal:** The end of the axon, where signals are passed to other neurons.

## Communication

Neurons communicate via electrochemical signals. This involves action potentials traveling down the axon and the release of neurotransmitters at the synapse. See [[Synaptic Transmission]] for details.

We also discuss related concepts in [[Brain Regions]].

### Key Neurotransmitters

| Neurotransmitter | Primary Function        |
|------------------|-------------------------|
| Dopamine         | Reward, Motivation      |
| Serotonin        | Mood, Sleep             |
| Acetylcholine    | Muscle Contraction      |
| GABA             | Inhibitory              |
