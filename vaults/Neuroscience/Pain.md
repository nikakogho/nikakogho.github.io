Typically from **nociceptive input** (pain signal from body)
Painful memory can also stimulate feeling pain without signal from body

Mostly in [[Skin|skin]] but also in bone, [[Muscles|muscle]], most internal organs, blood vessels and heart

## Lactic Acid

If you try working out more than your body is used to, your tissue oxygen levels canâ€™t keep up with oxygen demand and cells switch to anaerobic breathing, which produces waste as lactic acid. Buildup of lactic acid has a side effect of buildup of H<sup>+</sup> in extracellular matrix, which bind to H<sup>+</sup>-gated [[Ion channel|ion channels]] on nociceptors and cause pain

## Histamine

When a bee stings you, **mast** cells in your skin and connective tissue are activated and they release histamine, which binds to surface receptors on nociceptors and causes depolarization, so pain [[Spike|spike]]. They also make you swell. Antihistamine cream stops this

## Pain perception in brain

| **Aspect of Pain**          | **Brain Region**                      | **Function**                           |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Localization**            | Primary Sensory Cortex (S1)          | Identifies where the pain is.         |
| **Intensity**               | S1 and Thalamus                      | Evaluates pain strength.              |
| **Emotional Impact**        | Anterior Cingulate Cortex, Amygdala  | Adds unpleasantness and distress.     |
| **Cognitive Evaluation**    | Prefrontal Cortex                    | Thinks about and assesses pain.       |
| **Modulation**              | Periaqueductal Gray                  | Suppresses or amplifies pain signals. |
| **Integration**             | Insula                               | Links sensory, emotional, and visceral responses.

## Hyperalgesia

After damage, nociceptors become more sensitive for a while, so even light touch in that area hurts

### Primary Hyperalgesia

Exactly the damaged area has heightened pain sensation

### Secondary Hyperalgesia

Spreads to nearby areas

## Spice

Spiciness, a type of [[Taste|taste]], is actually a sense of pain caused by **Capsaicin** (present in peppers) binding to ion channel **TRPV1**

## Substance P

Nociceptors produce Substance P, which causes swelling in blood capillaries and makes mast cells produce **Histamine**
