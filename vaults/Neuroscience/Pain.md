Typically from **nociceptive input** (pain signal from body)
Painful memory can also stimulate feeling pain without signal from body

Mostly in [[Skin|skin]] but also in bone, [[Muscles|muscle]], most internal organs, blood vessels and heart

## Lactic Acid

If you try working out more than your body is used to, your tissue oxygen levels can’t keep up with oxygen demand and cells switch to anaerobic breathing, which produces waste as lactic acid. Buildup of lactic acid has a side effect of buildup of H<sup>+</sup> in extracellular matrix, which bind to H<sup>+</sup>-gated [[Ion channel|ion channels]] on nociceptors and cause pain

## Histamine

When a bee stings you, **mast** cells in your skin and connective tissue are activated and they release histamine, which binds to surface receptors on nociceptors and causes depolarization, so pain [[Spike|spike]]. They also make you swell. Antihistamine cream stops this

## Pain perception in brain

| **Aspect of Pain**          | **Brain Region**                      | **Function**                           |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Localization**            | Primary Sensory Cortex (S1)          | Identifies where the pain is.         |
| **Intensity**               | S1 and Thalamus                      | Evaluates pain strength.              |
| **Emotional Impact**        | Anterior Cingulate Cortex, Amygdala  | Adds unpleasantness and distress.     |
| **Cognitive Evaluation**    | Prefrontal Cortex                    | Thinks about and assesses pain.       |
| **Modulation**              | Periaqueductal Gray                  | Suppresses or amplifies pain signals. |
| **Integration**             | Insula                               | Links sensory, emotional, and visceral responses.

## Hyperalgesia

After damage, nociceptors become more sensitive for a while, so even light touch in that area hurts

### Primary Hyperalgesia

Exactly the damaged area has heightened pain sensation

### Secondary Hyperalgesia

Spreads to nearby areas

## Spice

Spiciness, a type of [[Taste|taste]], is actually a sense of pain caused by **Capsaicin** (present in peppers) binding to ion channel **TRPV1**

## Substance P

Nociceptors produce Substance P, which causes swelling in blood capillaries and makes mast cells produce **Histamine**.
Has role in moderate and intense pain.

## First and Second Pain

We feel pain twice. First, a fast but fading one and then a slow but long one.
Fast one is mediated by Aδ fibers, slow by C fibers

## In spinal cord

Pain enters the [[Spinal Cord|spinal cord]] at **Zone of Lissauer** and through **Substantia gelatinosa**

## Referred Pain

Visceral pain (from internal organs) goes through same pathways as cutaneous pain (from skin), so sometimes they get confused and body interprets visceral pain as occurring somewhere on the skin

### Examples

* Angina - heart lacks oxygen, people feel pain in chest and left arm
* Appendicitis - felt around abdominal wall

## Spinothalamic pain pathway

As name suggests, skin/viscera -> spinal cord -> [[Thalamus|thalamus]]

## Touch vs Pain pathways

Touch goes ipsilaterally, pain decussates early

## Pain regulation

Multiple things have the ability to increase or decrease sensation of pain.

What can decrease it:

* Placebo: belief that pain will go away because of some event can actually loosen up the pain receptors
* Large skin contact: large area input from skin inhibits pain senses
* **Periaqueductal Gray Matter (PAG)**: involved in inhibiting pain during stoic moments. Can be electrically stimulated to reduce pain
* Painkillers: aspirin, ibuprofen or paracetamol bind to protein **COX2** to stop it from making more **prostaglandins**, which are used to convey pain
* Opioids - block production of [[Glutamate]], so pain information can't be sent to brain

### Gate Theory of Pain

MIT scientists Melzack and Wall suggested that pain and large touch pass through same region of spinal cord and they are gated so lot of touch inhibits pain signal
