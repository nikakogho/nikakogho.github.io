### Cholinergic neurons

[[Acetylcholine]]
Muscle, motor neurons
Enzyme *choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)* is made in soma, travels to axon terminal and there it makes acetylcholine by taking acetyl group from acetyl CoA and mixing it with choline taken in from outside the cell.
Taking in choline from outside must be accompanied by Na<sup>+</sup> and is bottleneck for this process so itâ€™s called **rate-limiting**

**Acetylcholinesterase (AChE)** degrades ACh into acetyl and choline in synaptic cleft

### Catecholaminergic neurons

**Catecholamines** are [[Dopamine]] (DA), [[Norepinephrine]] (NE) and [[Epinephrine (Adrenaline)]]

Terminated by selective uptake back in axon terminal by Na<sup>+</sup>-dependent transporters
Amphetamine and cocaine block this step to keep you stimulated

**Monoamine oxidase (MAO)** sitting on outer membrane of mitochondria can destroy catecholamines once inside axon terminal

Synthesis

Tyrosine -> catalyzed by Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) into dopa -> catalyzed by Dopa decarboxylase into dopamine -> catalyzed by Dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DBH) into norepinephrine -> catalyzed by Phentolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT) into epinephrine

### Serotonergic neurons

**[[Serotonin]]** (5-HT) is made from amino acid *tryptophan*
Mood, emotional behavior, sleep
tryptophan is rate-limiter. It is supplied from blood where it gets from diet (grains, meat, dairy and chocolate)

Antidepressants inhibit serotonin reuptake, making them work longer

### Amino acidergic neurons

[[Glutamate]] (Glu), [[Glycine]] (Gly), and [[GABA|gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)]]
Glutamate and Glycine are among 20 amino acids for proteins

Enzyme Glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) catalyzes turning glutamate into GABA

Glutamate is excitatory
GABA is inhibitory

Reuptake by Na<sup>+</sup>-dependent transporters into neurons or glia
