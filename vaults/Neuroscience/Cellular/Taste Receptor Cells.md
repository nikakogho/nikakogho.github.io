[[Taste]]

Usually not considered a [[Neuron]], but almost is
Certain chemicals change cell's membrane potential, eventually opening Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and leading to physical and chemical [[Synapse]] with neurons

Lifespan 2 weeks

**Receptor potential** - voltage shift from chemicals binding to membrane, opening channels and causing enough depolarization to trigger release of [[Neurotransmitter|neurotransmitters]]
Sour and salty receptors release [[Serotonin]]
Sweet, bitter and umami release ATP
Some taste cells also use [[Acetylcholine]], [[GABA]] and [[Glutamate]] for unknown reasons

Most taste cells mostly respond to only 1 type of taste
