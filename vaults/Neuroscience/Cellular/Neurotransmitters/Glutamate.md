A [[Neurotransmitter]] for synaptic plasticity
Most abundant neurotransmitter in [[Central Nervous System]] (CNS)

Crucial for [[Long Term Potentiation]]

Fast excitatory signaling
Neurogenesis

Works with inhibitory neurotransmitters like [[GABA]] to balance excitation and inhibition in brain

Processing pain signals in brain and spinal cord

Supports cell survival and function
Excess levels cause **excitotoxicity** - neuron damage and death

## Glutamate-Glutamine cycle
Energy production in brain
