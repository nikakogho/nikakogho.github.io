Brief change in action potential, shifting such that inside of neuron is positive relative to outside

Transmits data in brain

Any cell that can do this has **excitable membrane**

By default cell at **resting membrane potential**, changing when \[\[Ion channel]] opens or closes

Resting membrane potential is made by Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup>

High potential = high intensity = multiple
spikes fired faster as potential gets higher

Generally 1 Hz
High potential can get up to 50 Hz firing speed
Max speed 1000 Hz called **absolute refractory period**
Travels at 10 m/sec

Rise because Na<sup>+</sup> channels open and it enters
Then fall because Na<sup>+</sup> channels close while K<sup>+</sup> channels open and they leave

Spike from soma to axon is **orthodromic conduction**
Backward is **antidromic conduction**

Spike travels faster in wider axon => important functions (like escape in squid) use wide axons

Myelinated areas speed up travel, with **nodes of Ranvier** in-between being places where it slows down and where ion channels are. This is called **saltatory conduction** from Greek word for jump because it seems like spikes jump from one node of Ranvier to next

## Steps

0. Rest at -95 to -60 mV
1. Threshold
2. Rising phase
3. Overshoot
4. Falling phase
5. Undershoot
6. Absolute refractory period
7. Relative refractory period

## Spike-initiation zone

Nerve ending in sensory neuron
**Axon hillock** in others

## Shunting Inhibition

Sometimes inhibition happens by opening up pores along the way to reduce membrane resistance and therefore make more of action potential leak out
