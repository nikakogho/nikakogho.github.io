[[Synapse#Chemical Synapse|Chemical synapse]] to [[Muscles]]

Presynaptic terminal has many active zones
Postsynaptic membrane **motor end-plate** has shallow folds packed with many [[Neurotransmitter]] receptors to receive many of them

Each motor [[Neuron]] can innervate many muscle fibers
Each muscle fiber gets input from only 1 motor neuron

## Motoneuron Types

Slow (S) - hours, uses O<sub>2</sub>
Fast fatigue resistant (FR) - 30 min, uses O<sub>2</sub> + glycogen
Fast fatigable (FF) - seconds to minutes, uses glycogen

### Orderly Recruitment

We engage more if we need more force:

1. S - standing sitting chilling (endurance)
2. FR - easy work like walking (strength)
3. FF - running jumping fighting etc (strength)

Strength workout makes recruitment easier
