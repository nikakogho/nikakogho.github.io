Categorized as *amino acids*, *amines* or *peptides*

Amino acids and amines carried in synaptic vesicles
Peptides in secretory granules

Neurotransmitter that opens \[\[Ion channel]] that brings brings action potential toward higher than threshold is **excitatory**, lower is **inhibitory**
Na<sup>+</sup> is generally excitatory
Cl<sup>-</sup> mostly inhibitory

## Examples

* \[\[Dopamine]]
* \[\[Serotonin]]
* \[\[Glutamate]]
* \[\[Oxytocin]]
* \[\[Melatonin]]
* \[\[Acetylcholine]]
* \[\[GABA]]
* \[\[Norepinephrine]]
* \[\[Beta-Endorphin]]
* \[\[Epinephrine (Adrenaline)]]
* \[\[Glycine]]
* ATP

## Synthesis

Peptides

1. made by rough ER
2. packaged by Golgi apparatus
3. secretory granules excreted
   4.¬†axoplasmic transport to axon terminal
4. released when spike comes

Amino acids and amines:

1. their synthesizing enzymes are transported to axon terminals
2. they are made there locally
3. **Transporters** put them in vesicles
4. Released during spike

Amino acids and amines can‚Äôt be made in same neuron - **Dale‚Äôs principle**

When peptide and amino acid or amine are made in same neuron they are **co-transmitters**

## Release

1. High voltage opens **voltage-gated calcium channels**
2. **Exocytosis** - high concentration of Ca<sup>2+</sup> causes vesicles and granules to release
3. Synaptic vesicle fuses to active zone, releases content into synaptic cleft
4. Fit into postsynaptic density
5. Eventually recycled by endocytosis

Peptide release needs higher action potential buildup and is slower

## Receptors

Postsynaptic density
Over 100 types classified as **transmitter-gated ion channel** and **G-protein coupled receptor**
Transmitter-gated ion channel is faster, used by amino acid and amine
G-protein coupled receptor is slower, used by all

Each receptor only takes 1 neurotransmitter
Each neurotransmitter may bind to multiple types of receptors called **receptor subtypes**

### G-protein coupled receptor

**Metabotropic receptors** - can cause wide chain reaction
Short for **Guanosine Triphosphate (GTP) binding protein**
Steps:

1. Neurotransmitter binds to receptor in postsynaptic membrane
2. Receptor activates small **G-proteins**, free to move inside face of postsynaptic membrane
3. G-proteins stimulate or inhibit ‚Äúeffector" proteins: G-protein-gated ion channels (**Shortcut Pathway**, called **membrane-delimited pathway** since all action is on membrane) or **second messengers** that activate other enzymes

#### G-protein steps

a) Made of ùõº, Œ≤ and Œ≥ parts, **Guanosine Diphosphate (GDP)** is bound to ùõº
b) if right neurotransmitter binds to receptor and G-protein binds to it, ùõº releases GDP and takes GTP instead
c) G-protein splits into G<sub>ùõº</sub> and G<sub>Œ≤Œ≥</sub> parts, each can affect some effector protein
d) G<sub>ùõº</sub> eventually breaks down GTP into GDP, ending its activity
e) subunits returb and merge to restart cycle

#### Second Messenger Cascades

Slower than Shortcut Pathway but can do more complex things

Stimulated - G<sub>s</sub>
Inhibited by G<sub>i</sub>
Can affect other neuron stuff or inside cell ER and other things
Can branch

##### Phosphorylation and Dephosphorylation

Main downstream enzymes are **protein kinases** PKA, PKC, CaMK.
They transfer phosphate (PO<sub>4</sub>) from ATP to to proteins - phosphorylation, which can make ion channels open/close
**Protein phosphatases** then eventually remove the phosphate from protein

##### Signal Amplification

Cascade can eventually affect many channels.

### Divergence and convergence

### Autoreceptors

On presynaptic side, to inhibit if too many neurotransmitters

### Studying receptors

**Neuropharmacological analysis**, **ligand-binding methods** and **molecular analysis of receptor**

#### Neuropharmacological analysis

Giving a drug to receptor to see if it reacts and binds and does its thing
Checks function

#### Ligand-binding

Checking if radioactive chemical will bind to receptor
Checks binding

#### Molecular analysis of receptor

Study structure of polypeptides that make up subunits of receptors

## Removal

Diffusion, reuptake into presynaptic side, by neurotransmitter transports in glia around synaptic cleft
Can also be destroyed in cleft itself by other enzymes

If not removed, **desensitization** will happen from overexposure, causing ion channels to close
Can stay desensitized for many seconds

## Agonists and Antagonists

Drug that binds to receptor and inhibits it is **receptor antagonist**
Drug that mimics neurotransmitter behavior is **receptor agonist**

## How to identify a neurotransmitter

Molecule must:

1. be synthesized and stored in presynaptic neuron
2. be released by axon terminal when stimulated
3. when experimentally applied, must stimulate postsynaptic terminal as a neurotransmitter would

Localization can be done by **Immunocytochemistry** and **in situ hybridization**

### Immunocytochemistry

Called *immunohistochemistry* on thin tissues of brain
Antibodies made for this neurotransmitter are tagged with visible marker and injected in tissue to show where neurotransmitter is

### In Situ Hybridization

To find out if cell makes a polypeptide/protein, fluorescent or radiactive versions of mRNA are made that will bind to mRNA responsible for making that protein, resulting glow or darkness revealing if the protein is there or not

* **Autoradiography** - radiation sensitive sheet reveals results
* **Fluorescent In Situ Hybridization (FISH)** - injected mRNA glows

### Microiontophoresis

Checking effect of neurotransmitter/drug by injecting it directly into postsynaptic area with a pipette
