Hydrophobic part in membrane, polar part outside

4-6 to let ions pass inside

Million molecules pass per second

**Selectivity** - some only for K<sup>+</sup> or for Ca<sup>2+</sup> etc
**Gating** - open or close based on situation inside cell

* **voltage-gated sodium channels**

**Ionic driving force** = membrane potential - equilibrium potential

## Voltage-gated sodium channel

4 domains I-IV
Each domain has 6 transmembrane alpha-helices S1-S6
Pore loop between S5 and S6 that forms into **selectivity filter** opened and closed by voltage sensor in S4

## Transmitter-gated Ion Channel

Ion channel that opens when \[\[Neurotransmitter]] binds to it
4-5 subunits form a pore closed by default
Causes postsynaptic neuron to depolarize by bringing in Na<sup>+</sup> or some other and causing a \[\[Spike]]
**Excitatory Postsynaptic Potential (EPSP)** - depolarization caused by this neurotransmitter binding to this channel
If the pore passes negative charge ion like Cl<sup>-</sup> then it is **Inhibitory Postsynaptic Potential (IPSP)**
\*\*Inhibitory Postsynaptic Potential (IPSP)

## Reversal Potential

When ion channel lets multiple ions pass, their average is target potential. If that is higher than membrane potential then ions flow in, else out
Value of membrane potential at which flow direction shifts is **reversal potential**
