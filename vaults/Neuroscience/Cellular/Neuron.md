Cell body (soma) - 20 micrometres diameter
Covered by **neuronal membrane**, which includes [[Ion channel|ion channels]] and [[Ion pump|ion pumps]]
Membrane has **capacitance** - stores electric potential by having anions on inside edge and cations on outside edge

[[Cytoskeleton]] for structure
**Neurites** - axon (output) and dendrites (input)
Neuron with 1 neurite is **unipolar**, 2 is **bipolar**, more is **multipolar**

## Axon

Axon starts at **axon hillock**
Branches out into **axon collaterals**, some of which may even return to the dendrite of this or neighboring neuron. Such axon collaterals are known as **recurrent collaterals**
Ends at **axon terminal** (**terminal bouton**) where [[Synapse]] is.
It has no microtubules
Has 50 nm diameter **synaptic vesicles**
Many mitochondria in terminal due to high energy need
One axon can branch out into many terminals, known as **terminal arbor**.
When neuron has synapse with cell it **innervates** that cell or gives **innervation**

When axon makes synapse with dendrite and then continues on its way it is **a bouton en passant**
![IMG_4316.jpeg](img_4316.jpeg)

Soma supplies axon with proteins in process called **axoplasmic transport** or by **anterograde transport** where **kinesin** “walks” on a microtubule to deliver the vesicle
There is also **retrograde transport** for when signal must be carried from axon to soma to notify about new metabolic needs, “walker” by **dynein**

### Myelinated axon types

* Association fibers - connect cortical regions in same hemisphere
* Projection fibers - take data from neocortex to lower centers ([[Midbrain]] or other part of [[Brain Stem]]), like **corticospinal tract** (opposite direction is **spinocortical tract**)
* Commisular fibers - connect hemispheres, like with [[Corpus Callosum]], but also maybe [[Cerebellum]]’s hemispheres or [[Spinal Cord]] or brain stem

## Dendrite

Together called **dendritic tree**, each one called **dendritic branch**
**Dendritic spines** are how neurons receive synapses. They have a head that has receptor and a neck that connects to dendrite

## Spikes

Action potential (Spike) is shift in neuron's potential electrical energy from flow of charged particles in and out of membrane.
When neuron is stimulated enough, spike is triggered
Lasts 2 ms

How it works:

* Resting potential of neuron is -70 mV maintained by sodium-potassium pump and selective permeability of membrane
* **Threshold depolarization** - when stimulus (input from another neuron) brings potential down to critical threshold of around -55 mV, voltage-gated sodium Na<sup>+</sup> channels open
* **Depolarization** - Na<sup>+</sup> rush into cell because of electrochemical gradient, making potential rise to +30 to +40 mV
* **Falling phase (repolarization)** - voltage-gated sodium channels close and potassium channels open. K<sup>+</sup> ions exit the cell and reset potential to resting amount
* **Afterhyperpolarization** - potential is temporarily lower than resting amount
* **Refractory period** - recovery period when new spike can't be triggered
  * **Absolute refractory period** - nothing can be triggered
  * **Relative refractory period** - only strong enough stimulus will trigger a spike

## Types

![Pasted_image_20241206143706.png](pasted_image_20241206143706.png)

* Motor neuron - brain and [[Spinal Cord]] use these to talk to muscles, organs and glands
* Sensory neuron - sound, touch, heat, light, smell, taste get sent from body to brain with these
* Interneurons - most common, connect neurons to each other to form networks

  Long neurons are *Golgi Type I*
  Short are *Golgi Type II*
