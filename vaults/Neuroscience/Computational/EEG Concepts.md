## Time Locked

One event always happens exactly x seconds after another

## Phase Locked

Time locked + amplitude and other features remain same

## Dipole Angle

a) Radial best for EEG
b) best for MEG
c) likely to cancel itself because of opposite side
d) for EEG but too far

## P300

300 milliseconds after a person detects something unusual (like red ball among a sequence of green balls), his brain will light up, especially in Pz part of [[Parietal lobe|parietal lobe]]
