AKA neopallium or isocortex or six-layered cortex

In mammals
Higher brain functions like learning and memory, conscious perception of senses, goal-directed behavior

Made of most parts of [[Frontal lobe]], [[Parietal lobe]], [[Temporal lobe]], [[Occipital lobe]] and [[Insula|Insular lobe]]
Parts of them that have the 6 layer architecture are what count (for example, [[Hippocampus]] in temporal lobe is not part of neocortex, and neither is **olfactory cortex**)
Divided into **true isocortex** and **proisocortex**
Makes up brain together with [[Allocortex]]

## Layers

![IMG_3386.png](img_3386.png)

* Layer I (molecular layer) - mostly dendrites and axons, very few neurons
* Layer II (external granular layer) - small pyramidal and stellate neurons
* Layer III (external pyramidal layer) - pyramidal neurons that branch out to other layers
* Layer IV (internal granular layer) - gets sensory input from [[Thalamus]]
* Layer V (internal pyramidal layer) - large pyramidal neurons that branch to other structures
* Layer VI (multiform layer) - connects to thalamus and others
