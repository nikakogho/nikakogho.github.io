## Anterior Lobe

Makes hormones:

* Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH or corticotrophin) - body response to stress, stimulates adrenal glands to make cortisol
* Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) - stimulates producing sperm in males, estrogen in females (gonadotrophic hormone)
* Growth Hormone (GH)
* Luteinizing Hormone (LH) - stimulates ovulation in females, testosterone in males
* Prolactin - stimulates lactation (breast milk production) after giving birth
* Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) - stimulates thyroid to make thyroid hormones for managing metabolism

## Posterior Lobe

Hypothalamus makes these hormones, then posterior lobe stores and releases them:

* Antidiuretic hormone (ADH) - water balance and sodium levels
* Oxytocin - helps labor in females, causes breastmilk flow, helps parent and child bond. Moves sperm for males
