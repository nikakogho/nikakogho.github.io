German neuroanatomist Korbinian Brodmann realized that areas of cerebral cortex that look different must have different functions and came up with areas that match closely with later found results

## Important Areas

4. [[Motor Cortex#Primary Motor Cortex (M1)|Primary Motor Cortex (M1)]]
5. Premotor cortex mostly and Supplementary Motor Area on top
6. [[Prefrontal Cortex|Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex (DLPFC)]] part of prefrontal cortex for working memory, attention, executive functions
7. Parts of Prefrontal cortex:
   1. **Orbitofrontal Cortex** - decisions, social awareness, future plans
   2. **Medial Prefrontal Cortex (mPFC)** - self-referential thinking and decision-making
   3. **Anterior Prefrontal Cortex** (frontopolar region) - abstract thinking and long-term plans
8. Orbitofrontal cortex
9. [[Cuneus]], part of [[Visual Cortex]]
10. [[Wernicke’s Area]]
11. Medial Prefrontal Cortex - emotion regulation and conflict monitoring, part of [[Cingulate cortex|anterior cingulate cortex]]
12. Medial Prefrontal Cortex - emotion, motivation, higher-level cognitive control
13. [[Auditory Cortex|Primary Auditory Cortex]]
14. Primary Auditory Cortex
15. Includes [[Broca’s Area]]
16. Includes Broca's Area
