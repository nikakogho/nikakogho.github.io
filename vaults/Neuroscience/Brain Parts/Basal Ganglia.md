## Function

For choosing and learning
Inhibits all movement until asked otherwise

* Motor control - selects what action to do
* Motor learning
* Forming habits
* Cognitive and emotional functions - talks to \[\[Prefrontal Cortex]]
* Reward and motivation

**Direct pathway** - striatum receives order to smile or something, inhibits part of pallidum that was inhibiting that (double negative)
**Indirect pathway** - goes through steps and eventually excites pallidum cells to inhibit some moves

## Parts

* Striatum - main input receiver, receiving from cortex, \[\[Thalamus]] and others
  * Made of \[\[Caudate Nucleus]] and \[\[Putamen]]
  * **Dorsal Striatum** - motor and cognitive functions
  * **Ventral Striatum** (including nucleus accumbens) - reward and motivation
* Globus Pallidus (GP) - inhibition of movement
  * External segment (GPe) - indirect pathway
  * Internal segment (GPi) - major output nucleus to thalamus
* \[\[Subthalamus]] Nucleus (STN) - gives excitatory input to GPi and modulates motor output
* \[\[Substantia Nigra]] (SN)
  * Pars compacta (SNc) - makes dopamine that modulates striatal activity
  * Pars reticulata (SNr) - output nucleus like GPi
* Nucleus Accumbens - part of ventral striatum - reward, motivation, addiction

## Parkinson

Failure of direct pathway

## Huntington's

Failure of indirect pathway - you move too much
