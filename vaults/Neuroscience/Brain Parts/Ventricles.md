Cerebrospinal fluid flows in ventricles, working as a cooler, damage absorber, nourishment and waste removal

2 lateral ventricles, third ventricle and fourth ventricle

Produced by **Choroid plexus**

## Location

* Lateral ventricles
  * \[\[Corpus Callosum]] runs over them
  * \[\[Septum pallucidum]] is between them
  * Under them are \[\[Thalamus]], \[\[Caudate Nucleus]] and \[\[Hippocampus]]
* Third ventricle
  * In front of it is \[\[Hypothalamus]]
  * Behind it is \[\[Pineal gland]]
  * Hole inside it is \[\[Massa Intermedia]]
* Fourth ventricle
  * Goes into \[\[Cerebellum]]
  * In front of it is \[\[Pons]]

## Cerebrospinal fluid flow

0. Made by choroid plexus
1. into lateral ventricles
2. into third ventricle
3. into cerebral aqueduct
4. fourth ventricle
5. through foramina of fourth ventricle into **subarachnoid space** in brain and spinal cord
6. **arachnoid granulations** in subarachnoid space let it get absorbed into bloodstream

## Foramena Luschka

On sides for releasing fluid in fourth ventricle

## Foramen of Magendie

Also for releasing fluid in fourth ventricle
