Axons of receptor cells go through **cribriform plate** and synapse on **glomeruli**, spheres of bundles of synapses, which each connect to a second-order olfactory neuron, which then sends out an axon that together with others makes up olfactory nerve

Each bulb has >2000 glomeruli, each receiving about 25 000 smell receptor axons
