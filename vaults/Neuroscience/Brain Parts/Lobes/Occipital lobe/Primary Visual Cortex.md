AKA V1 or striate cortex

Part of \[\[Visual Cortex]] in \[\[Occipital lobe]]
First stage of \[\[Vision]]
\[\[Brodmann Areas|Brodmann area 17]]
Receives data from LGN in \[\[Thalamus]] and sends data back to it
Also sends data to V2

Detects lines, edges at certain angles, simple motion

Separated in 2 parts by **calcarine fissure**

Top down rotated, bottom of V1 is top of visual and vice versa

V1 actually has 9 layers, since layer IV is actually IVA, IVB and IVC (with IVC also having alpha and beta parts)
Layer I is next to \[\[Meninges|pia]]

![Pasted\_image\_20250314151515.png](pasted_image_20250314151515.png)
Layer IV has spiny stellate cells, rest are pyramidal. Mostly only pyramidal axons leave V1

M cells go to IVC alpha
P cells go to IVC beta
Koniocellular (nonM-nonP) go to layers II and III

Left and right eye data enter layer IV in alternating column layers

Layer IVC projects up to IVB and III

In Layer III left and right eye data start to mix in **ocular dominance columns**

## Ocular Dominance

## Outputs

II III and IV to other cortical areas
V to superior colliculus in \[\[Midbrain]] and to \[\[Pons]]
VI back to LGN

## Receptive Fields

Mostly similar to magnocellular and parvocellular receptive fields of LGN (center-surround)

Layer IVCα doesn't care about color
Layer IVCβ has center-surround color opponency

### Binocular Receptive Fields

Some parts of V1 mix input from both eyes, this helps with **stereoscopic vision** (taking 2D image from 2 angles to construct 3D model in mind) for detailed 3D motions like needle threading

### Orientation Selectivity

Most neurons in LGN and layer IVC have circular receptive fields, but outside IVC we find neurons preferring certain angles
![Pasted\_image\_20250319135521.png](pasted_image_20250319135521.png)
**Orientation column** - neurons down the same column (different layers) have same angle orientation selectivity. This is not an entirely accurate model, as seen by this chart where

* blue = 0°
* red = 45°
* yellow = 90°
* green = 135°
  ![Pasted\_image\_20250319140425.png](pasted_image_20250319140425.png)
  For horizontal moves (parallel to surface) in a single layer, orientation slowly shifts

**Simple cells** get aggregate of neighboring center-surround antagonistic LGN neurons which gives them the linear direction, must be at right part of receptive field
**Complex cells** must have right shape at any spot

## Possible parallel pathways

Hypothetical model (simplified) of 3 pathways in V1. Simplified because in reality signals mix

## Cortical Module

Idealized model of 2x2 mm wide section in V1 that has ocular dominance columns, orientation columns and **cytochrome oxidase blobs** (actual module wouldn't be this orderly)
