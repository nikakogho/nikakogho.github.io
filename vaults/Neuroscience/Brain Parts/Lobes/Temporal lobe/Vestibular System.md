In \[\[Ear#Inner ear|inner ear]]

Otoconial organ (otolith, made of urticle + saccule) is for linear acceleration
Semicircular canals for angular acceleration

Domino of cilia, tallest one is **kinocilium**
By default at -40 mV so it can detect both directions of change
Excite = toward kinocilium
Inhibit = from kinocilium

Ear canals in opposite ears get opposite effect (**yoked**)

Yoked pairs:

* Horizontals of each ear
* Superior of one with posterior of another

## Scarpa's ganglion

\[\[Neuron]] on which vestibular sensory neurons synapse. Its axons make up the vestibular nerve, part of \[\[Cranial Nerves|Cranial Nerve VIII, the vestibulocochlear nerve]]

## Otolith organs

Linear acceleration, don't feel it in steady movement of car/plane/whatever
Has sensory epithelium **macula**, vertically in saccule and horizontally in utricle
Macula has hair cells. Their sensitivity is because of **otoconia**, tiny dense crystals on top of them in a gel. When head rotates, gravity pulls otoconia which move the gelatinous cap and so hair cells also move and cause a \[\[Spike|spike]]
Same stimulus that excites otoliths of one ear inhibit it in other ear, and this total data lets the brain get full understanding of our head rotation and movement

## Semicircular Canals

These also have hair cells stuck in gel that is moved by fluid movement. They react to angular acceleration so constant rotation speed is not detected
Here also excitation in one ear is inhibition in other
Canals give opposing movement to rotation for a while, which is why suddenly stopping rotation can make you dizzy

## Central Vestibular Pathways

Cranial Nerve VIII takes vestibular data to cerebellum and to medial and lateral **vestibular nuclei** of \[\[Brain Stem]]

From lateral nuclei

* some signals go to cerebellum
* otoliths go to limb motor neurons through **vestibulospinal tract**

From medial vestibular nuclei

* some go to **ventral posterior** (VP) nucleus of \[\[Thalamus]]
* some to extraocular motor neurons (cranial nerves III, IV and VI)
* semicircular canal synapses in medial vestibular nuclei go to neck motor neurons through **medial longitudinal fasciculus**

## Vestibuloocular reflex (VOR)

Fixes gaze during rotation (biker’s head is up when bike is tilting, you focus in item when moving your head)
![IMG\_4878.jpeg](img_4878.jpeg)
![Pasted\_image\_20250409115018.png](pasted_image_20250409115018.png)

Semicircular canal sends data to Cranial Nerves III and VI so they adjust eye’s rotation and move toward/away nose to keep gaze

**Nystagmus** - if rotation suddenly stops the eyes keep the “pulsating” effect of still moving that way and resetting, moving resetting and so on for about 30 seconds

**Flocculus** in \[\[Cerebellum]] tells vestibular system the intensity of VOR (higher for near objects)
