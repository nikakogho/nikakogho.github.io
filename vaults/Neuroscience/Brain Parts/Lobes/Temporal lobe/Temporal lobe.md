Helps use senses to understand and respond to outside world
Communication, memories, language, processing emotions

Left: language, speech, verbal memory, melody processing
Right: non-verbal memory, visual patterns, face recognition, emotion processing, spatial processing, tone/pitch processing

Separated from [[Frontal lobe]] by [[Lateral sulcus]]

* Superior temporal gyrus
  * holds **primary auditory cortex** (Brodmann areas 41 and 42)
  * Processes pitch, volume, rhythm
  * Parts of [[Wernickeâ€™s Area]] for language comprehension
  * Distinguishing speech from other sounds
* Middle temporal gyrus - semantic memory (meaning of words and concepts)
  * processes visual and audio
  * narrative comprehension
  * social cognition
* Inferior temporal gyrus - object and face recognition, visual memory
* [[Hippocampus]] - explicit memories, spatial navigation
* [[Amygdala]] - emotions, fear/pleasure, emotional memory, recognizing emotional cues like face expressions and tone
* [[Parahippocampal gyrus]] - memory encoding and retrieval, processing scenes and context
* [[Entorhinal Cortex]] - anterior part of Parahippocampal gyrus. Main input and output between hippocampus and neocortex. Memory formation and spatial navigation
* [[Perirhinal cortex]] - near entorhinal cortex. Object recognition, associative memory, integrating senses to form complex representations
* Fusiform Gyrus - from temporal lobe to [[Occipital lobe]]. Face recognition and complex visual patterns like text
