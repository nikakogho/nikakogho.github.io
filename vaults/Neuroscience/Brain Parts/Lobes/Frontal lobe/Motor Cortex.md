Planning, control and execution of voluntary movement.
Located in [[Frontal lobe]] in *precentral gyrus*.

## Primary Motor Cortex (M1)

Anterior to [[Central sulcus]]
Controls movement by sending signals to motor neurons in [[Spinal Cord]] via [[Corticospinal Tract]]

### Motor Homonculus

Each part of primary motor cortex corresponds to controlling a specific body part
**Somatotopic map** - neighboring body parts mapped next to each other in primary motor cortex

## Strange truth of primary motor cortex neurons

Despite the homunculus, each neuron doesnâ€™t simply affect one muscle. Instead, population encoding is used, with each neuron giving direction code for multiple muscles

### Controlling motor neuron pools

[[Corticospinal Tract]] axons originate in layer V of M1 and inhibit flexor motor neuron pools while exciting extensors or vice-versa

This layer V itself gets input from:

* PMA
* SMA
* Primary [[Somatosensory Cortex]] (S1)
* A part of ventral lateral nucleus of [[Thalamus]] called VL<sub>c</sub>, which is supplied from [[Cerebellum]]

## Premotor Cortex

Anterior to primary motor cortex

Planning and preparation of movements, especially when guided by sensory cues like visual or tactile stimuli
Role in learning new motor sequences (movements) and integrating sensory data into motor plans (how to flex each muscle in hand to grab an apple that sits there)

Talks to primary motor cortex and spinal cord to refine and execute movements

## Supplementary Motor Area (SMA)

Medial and superior to premotor cortex, on medial surface of hemisphere

Coordinates complex moves and internally generated moves (deciding to move without an external trigger)
Role in bilateral motor coordination like when task needs both hands
For mental rehearsal of movements

## Cingulate Motor Area

Medial surface of cerebral cortex in [[Cingulate gyrus]]

Involved in motivation to perform movement
Role in goal-directed movements and reinforcement learning

Connects to:

* Primary motor cortex and supplementary motor area for movement execution
* Prefrontal cortex for connecting executive functions and decision making with motor planning
* Posterior Parietal Cortex to incorporate sensory data into motor plans

Interacts with [[Basal Ganglia]] and [[Cerebellum]] for motor coordination, timing and learning
Sends output to spinal cord for motor commands

Damage here can affect movement and emotions
