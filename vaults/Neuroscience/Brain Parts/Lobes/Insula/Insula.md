Insular Cortex
AKA “island of reil” or “insular lobe”

Bridge between body and brain
Deep inside [[Lateral sulcus]] of each hemisphere
Linked to consciousness, emotion, and regulating homeostasis

Covered by portions of [[Temporal lobe]], [[Frontal lobe]] and [[Parietal lobe]] known as [[Opercula]]

Anterior insula - complex emotions, cognitive and social processes

Posterior insula - sensory and autonomic functions

## Functions

* Interoception (body awareness) - gets senses from heart, gut, lungs etc. to sense hunger, pain, temperature, heartbeat
* Emotion processing (anterior insula) - processes disgust, pain, happiness and sadness. Translates body states into subjective feelings
* Homeostasis regulation - gets sensory information and communicates to [[Hypothalamus]] and autonomic centers
* Cognitive functions (anterior insula) - decision making, risk assessment, time perception. Works as part of [[Salience network]] identifying and prioritizing important stimuli
* Social understanding and empathy - social bonds, compassion
* Processing pain and tactile, thermal, and visceral (internal) senses

## Damage

Damage to insula can cause addiction, anxiety, depression, stroke, chronic pain and schizophrenia
