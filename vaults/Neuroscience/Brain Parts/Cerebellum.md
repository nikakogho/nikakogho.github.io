**Efference copy** - copy of motor commands gets sent to it
**Sensory reafference** - copy of sensory input also gets sent to it

## Functions

Roughly:

* Vermis for midline moves like walking and posture
* Paravermis for limbs
* Lateral lobes unclear purpose
* Flocculus for eye movement

**Cerebrocerebellum** - largest, made of lateral hemispheres. Planning and learning movements, coordinating muscle activation
Gets input from cerebral cortex and pontine nuclei, sends output to \[\[Thalamus]] and \[\[Red Nucleus]]

**Spinocerebellum** - vermis and intermediate zones, for error correction in movement, also receives proprioceptive data (data about movement)

**Vestibulocerebellum** - floccunolodular lobe. Balance, ocular reflexes, fixing on target.
Inputs from \[\[Vestibular System]] in inner ear and outputs to vestibular

## Cerebellar Learning

We learn in **open cerebellar loop** - slow process >20 ms
We automatically use **closed cerebellar loop** for "muscle memory" - fast <20 ms
