Cognitive Load Theory (CLT) says 

total cognitive load = intrinsic + extraneous + germane load
Must find sweet amount for working memory
- If total is too low => bored learner doesn’t pay attention and won’t learn
- If total is too high => frustrated learner quits

## Intrinsic
Difficulty of material: how many moving parts must be connected to get it
Easier if you already know some parts
Can be made easier by breaking down in learning parts separately

Example: learning a word “elephant” is easier than understanding angular momentum on a rotating hand of a robot standing on the edge of a spinning rocket

## Extraneous
Difficulty added by form of presentation, like hard to read slides
Must minimize

## Germane
Load produced from person engaging with material, interacting, answering questions, asking questions, reasoning through tasks, getting hands on
Good, the more the better

## Principles
- Coherence - remove extraneous stuff like unneeded words and pictures
- Modality - visual + narration > visual + text because better to engage both [[Visual Cortex]] and [[Auditory Cortex]]
- Redundancy - don’t repeat same info in audio and text as it adds to extraneous load
- Spatial Contiguity - put related stuff together on screen so learners don’t need to split attention, reducing extraneous load
- Temporal Contiguity - give narration and animation at the same time, not one after another
- Worked Example - give step by step example to reduce intrinsic load by giving a skeleton
- Segmenting - smaller segments is better
- Personalization - saying “you” is better than impersonal formal tone, can increase engagement and relax a person, reducing extraneous load
- Variability (advanced) - give various examples and questions so learners widen their understanding
- Goal-Free Effect - give tasks without specific goal, lets learners focus more on thinking about the topic instead of just finding one answer, stimulating forward-thinking and exploration of ideas
- Completion - give half done tasks they must fill. Forces participation (germane load)
- Fading Guidance - decrease teacher’s support after each task till it’s eventually 0

## What eyes say about cognitive load
Load is increased if we see:
- Pupil dilation - expanred pupil means more mental effort used
- Fixation duration - staring at one place for long means processing more complex info or higher cognitive load
- Blink rate - more means more load
- Saccade events (rapid eye movements) - fewer events typically means higher load

These effects are ruined if light changes in room as it affects pupils and blinks

## Hand motion
With some machine learning we can correlate hand gestures to cognitive load
Would likely need VR to force hand movements though

## Typing and speech
Could also infer from typing pattern (speed, errors, word complexity) or speech pattern
Would need to be personalized

## Audio and visual
Facial expressions, vocal characteristics, like how lie detectors assume that increased cognitive load is lying

## EEG
BCIs like [[Neurosity Crown]] can directly measure focus through gamma [[Brainwaves]]
