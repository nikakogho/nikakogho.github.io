Highly synchronized [[Spike|spikes]] in [[Hippocampus]] that happen mostly in sleep and little bit when awake for long term memory consolidation

## When awake
They “bookmark” neural pathways probably by increasing plasticity in relevant [[Synapse|synapses]]

## When asleep
They rush through the hippocampus, causing each of the pathways recorded while awake to get stimulated into sending information over to [[Neocortex]] for long term storage
