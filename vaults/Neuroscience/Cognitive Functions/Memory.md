Change in [[Synapse]]

Short term "working memory" mostly in [[Prefrontal Cortex]]
Long term in [[Hippocampus]]

Made by [[Long Term Potentiation]] (LTP)

## Types
**Working** - 4-7 items thing
**Implicit**
- walking
- pain
- reflexes
- emotional memories like fears and PTSD
- pattern recognition
**Explicit (declarative)** - "I live at this address"
- Semantic - "Tbilisi is capital of Georgia"
	- Stored in [[Neocortex]] and can be recalled from there directly
- Episodic  - "Yesterday we had a fight"
	- Also stored in neocortex but must go back to hippocampus for **reconsolidation** where they get edited and updated (potentially replaced with wrong data) upon each recall

Episodic memory over time becomes semantic memory, because after retelling it enough times we end up remembering it as cold data of someone telling it, not as experience of living through it
