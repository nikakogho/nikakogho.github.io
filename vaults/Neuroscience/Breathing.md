## Eupnea
Automatic breathing when not in danger

Breathe in - diaphragm contracts, [[Thoracic Cavity]] enlarges

Breathe out - opposite

Modulated by [[Central Pattern Generator]] for eupnea in [[Medulla oblongata]] which gives rhytm to motor neurons in C3-C5 of [[Spinal Cord]] which controls diaphragm

Damage in C3-C1 would cause [[Ondineâ€™s Curse]]
