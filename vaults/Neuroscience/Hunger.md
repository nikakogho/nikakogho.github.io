Protein **leptin** is supposed to regulate how hungry we feel.

Body can decrease its sensitivity to leptin, which would be same as if we had leptin shortage, and it would cause urge to overeat and cause obesity.

Similarly, too high leptin can cause anorexia.

## Hypothalamus Effect

**Lateral hypothalamic syndrome** - bilateral lesion in lateral [[Hypothalamus]] causes anorexia.

**Ventromedial hypothalamic syndrome** - bilateral lesion in ventromerial hypothalamus causes overeating.
