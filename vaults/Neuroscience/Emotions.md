Before we get conscious of it, [[Limbic System]] through [[Hypothalamus]] decides how to make body react to whatever is going on, and based on that reaction just by reading what’s going on in body like rising blood pressure and tense muscles and such the [[Prefrontal Cortex]] decides “oh I guess I’m feeling angry”

[[Epinephrine (Adrenaline)]] for example excites the body and then conscious mind takes that information and decides if this is panic or hype

- [[Pain]]
- [[Pleasure]]
- [[Anger]]
- [[Sadness]]
- [[Love]]
