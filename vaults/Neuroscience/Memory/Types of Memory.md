# Types of Memory

Memory isn't a single entity. We classify it in several ways.

## By Duration

* **Sensory Memory:** Very brief, holds sensory info.
* **Short-Term / [[Working Memory]]:** Holds info temporarily for manipulation (seconds to minutes).
* **Long-Term Memory:** Stores information for extended periods.

## By Content (Long-Term)

* **Explicit (Declarative):** Consciously recalled facts and events.
    * *Episodic:* Personal experiences (e.g., your last birthday).
    * *Semantic:* General world knowledge (e.g., Paris is the capital of France).
* **Implicit (Non-declarative):** Unconscious recall.
    * *Procedural:* Skills and habits (e.g., riding a bike).
    * *Priming:* Exposure influences response.
    * *Classical Conditioning:* Learned associations.
