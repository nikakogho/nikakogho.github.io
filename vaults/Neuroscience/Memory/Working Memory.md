# Working Memory

Working memory is a system for temporarily storing and managing the information required to carry out complex cognitive tasks such as learning, reasoning, and comprehension. It's distinct from short-term memory, emphasizing manipulation rather than just storage.

It links heavily with attention and executive functions controlled by the [[Brain Regions|Frontal Lobe]]. See also [[Types of Memory]].
