5 types: sweet, sour, salty, bitter, umami
We might also have it for carbonation, starch, fat, calcium, and water, but not enough evidence yet

Each food is combination of tastes + [[Smell]] + texture + temperature + pain (like for spicy)

Mostly through [[Tongue]]
Done by [[Taste Receptor Cells]]

**Threshold concentration** - how much of taste must arrive on papillae in tongue to trigger sensing
Most papillae are triggered by only 1 of the 5 tastes at threshold, but to more as concentration goes up

## Types

### Sweet

Artificial sweeteners are 10 000 - 100 000 times sweeter than sucrose

### Sour

Acids
Body detects pH change

### Salty

Salts

### Bitter

Like coffee
Even 1 molecule of bitter can often be detected. Good because poisons are often bitter

### Umami

Like good taste of [[Glutamate]]

## Taste Transduction

**Tastants** - taste stimuli can

1. Pass through [[Ion channel]] - salt and sour
2. Bind/block ion channels - sour
3. Bind to G-protein coupled receptors activating second messengers that open other ion channels - bitter, sweet, umami

Taste information is carried by [[Cranial Nerves]]

* VII (facial) for front of tongue
* IX (glossopharyngeal) for back of tongue
* X (vagus nerve) fot epiglottis
  They move to **left gustatory nucleus** in [[Medulla oblongata]] and then get moved to **Ventral Posterior Medial (VPM)** nucleus in [[Thalamus]] and then to [[Primary Gustatory Cortex]]

## T1R and T2R

Families of taste receptor proteins for bitter, sweet and umami

Bitter receptors are T2Rs
Sweet = T1R2 + T1R3
Umami = T1R1 + T1R3
