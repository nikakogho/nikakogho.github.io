In [[Skin|skin]] mostly, but also in [[Thalamus|thalamus]] to detect temperature of blood flowing in and in some visceral organs

Humans can notice temperature change on scale of 0.01Â°C

Temperature receptors have a range. Above or below that range cells get actual damage (burn or freeze) and **nociceptors** ([[Pain|pain]] receptors) activate, so warm food vs too hot food are processed quite differently by brain

Some parts of skin are more sensitive to temperature change than others. Some are even specifically hyper sensitive to only hot or only cold, and some areas between them are relatively insensitive to temperature at all (but still sensitive to pain from burning or freezing of tissue damage)

We mostly feel the change in temperature, so after a few seconds we adapt and feel less

## Temperature Pathway
Same as [[Pain#Spinothalamic pain pathway|pain pathway]]
