With **olfactory epithelium** in [[Nose]]
Chemical sense
Also involved in [[Taste]]

20% of smells smell good
Practice makes it better

**Pheromones** - clear reproductive role in animals, unclear in humans

Olfactory receptor cells are one of the only types of [[Neuron]] to always regenerate and get replaced

Humans have 350 genes coding for
different smell receptor proteins
Odorant genes are 3-5% of mammal genome

Timing (firing rate) also matters for encoding smell data

## Transduction

Odorant binds to receptor protein, which is a secondary [[Ion channel]] activating G<sub>olf</sub> protein -> it interacts with Adenylyl cyclade to make cAMP which then opens up Na<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and start depolarization. Then Cl<sup>-</sup> also opens and helps with depolarization (because thereâ€™s more of it on inside so it leaves)

Many cilia connect to 1 dendrite. Each smell receptor neuron has 1 dendrite

To [[Frontal lobe]]:
olfactory receptor cell -> [[Olfactory bulb]] -> olfactory tract -> olfactory tubercle -> **Medial dorsal nucleus** of [[Thalamus]] -> [[Prefrontal Cortex|orbitofrontal cortex]]

To [[Temporal lobe]]:
olfsctory receptor cell -> bulb -> tract -> [[Olfactory Cortex]] and others
