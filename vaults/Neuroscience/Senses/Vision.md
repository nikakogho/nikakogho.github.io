Light hits retina -> specific wavelength sensors turn that light into \[\[Spike|spikes]] and send them through \[\[Cranial Nerves|optic nerve]] to \[\[Thalamus]] and then to \[\[Visual Cortex]]

Happens with \[\[Eye]]
For motion detection and \[\[Object Detection]]

Retina detects differences in intensity in different places where light hits it

## Rods

Shapes, luminosity

## Cones

Colors, edges.
Red Green Blue by wavelength

## LGN

Lateral Geniculate Nucleus
In Thalamus, figures out how to relay to visual cortex

Retina -> LGN <---> \[\[Primary Visual Cortex|V1]]

Retina to LGN is called **optic radiation**

in fact V1 sends much more data to LGN than retina does

## \[\[Visual Cortex]]

## \[\[Face Recognition]]

## Saccade

Rapid eye movement to adjust gaze, works together with \[\[Vestibular System]]
Ballistic: once it starts, it ends where it was meant
Target is picked, then 200ms later saccade triggers to bring eye there and keep it there

Horizontal gaze center in \[\[Pons]] moves lateral rectus of both eyes to renew focus point
Vertical gaze center in \[\[Midbrain]] moves eyes vertically
**Vergence** (moving eyes together or apart for near/far vision) also in midbrain
**Superior colliculus** in midbrain is automatic gaze adjustment toward some action

Movements are decided in **Frontal Eye Fields** in \[\[Frontal lobe]]

## Eye Muscles

## Color Vision

5 million cones in retina are each red green or blue and are arranged differently and at different amounts for each person

## Phototransduction

### Dark current

In the dark

1. enzyme guanylyl cyclase makes second messenger **cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)**
2. it opens Na<sup>+</sup> channel
3. Na<sup>+</sup> flows in and makes resting membrane potential of rod's outer segment -30 mV instead of standard -65 mV

### When light hits

1. Light decreases cGMP amount
2. Na+ channels close
3. Neurons hyperpolarize (in negative direction)

#### Calcium for balance

This effect is slowly undone and balance is restored thanks to Calcium that also flows in same channel where Na<sup>+</sup> flows. Calcium there stops cGMP production, so when it stops flowing the cGMP production pumps again and balance is restored

### Rhodopsin

Light hitting decreases cGMP production because pigment rhodopsin in rod's outer segment absorbs light and undergoes a chemical reaction because of it

Rhodopsin is made of protein **opsin** + prebound agonist **retinal** (derivative of vitamin A)

#### Bleaching

Absorption of light activates opsin, changing rhodopsin photopigment color from default of purple to yellow.
This process stimulates a G-protein **transducin** that makes **phosphodiesterase** (PDE) that breaks down cGMP

### Detailed "when light hits"

1. rhodopsin on rod's outer segment absorbs light
2. opsin is activated
3. **Bleaching** - rhodopsin changes from purple to yellow
4. **Transducin** is stimulated
5. Transducin makes **phosphodiesterase** (PDE)
6. PDE breaks down cGMP
7. Na<sup>+</sup> channels close
8. Hyperpolarization

## Photoreceptors to Ganglions

Ganglions take inputs from bipolar cells directly and amacrine cells indirectly.
Bipolar cells take input from photoreceptors directly and horizontal cells indirectly.

Bipolar cells are ON or OFF cells: ON cells depolarize (spike) in light, while off cells turn off in light.

Rod bipolar cells only stimulate ganglions indirectly through amacrine cells.

### Center-Surround Receptive Field

Horizontal cells give surrounding bipolar cells opposite effect to that of center bipolar cell

## Ganglions

Only retinal cells that spike
Talk to optic nerve

ON-center and OFF-center ganglions exist, each do nothing if center and surround get same light.

Ganglions always fire.
ON-center ones fire more when light on center.
OFF-center opposite

### P and M ganglion cells

P - small
M - large

M has bigger receptive fields, is more sensitive to small light shifts and responds with burst.
P does constant discharge while stimulus is on.

90% of ganglions are P cells
5% are M cells
5% are other nonM-nonP cells

![IMG\_5069.jpeg](img_5069.jpeg)

### Color opponency

Some P and nonM-nonP ganglions can be ON center for one color and OFF surround for another,
like ON center red and OFF surround green is written as R<sup>+</sup>G<sup>-</sup>
![IMG\_5070.png](img_5070.png)
M ganglions donâ€™t distinguish color, only light vs dark

Overall ganglions tell optic nerve about:

* light vs dark
* red vs green
* blue vs yellow

### Photoreceptive ganglions

intrinsically photosensitive Retinal Ganglion Cells (ipRGC) have **melanopsin** as photopigment (frog skin also has it)

Unlike with rods and cones, ipRGCs depolarize with light

For \[\[Circadyan Rhythm]]

## Retinofugal Projection

"Fugal" - fleeing from

Retinofugal projection - neural pathway coming from retina

Path: optic nerve -> optic chiasm -> optic tract -> \[\[Brain Stem]] or LGN -> \[\[Primary Visual Cortex]]

Optic nerve exists eye at **optic disk**
![Pasted\_image\_20250309064402.png](pasted_image_20250309064402.png)

**Retinotectal projection** - part of optic tract (10% in humans) goes to **superior colliculus** in \[\[Midbrain]] and is used for adjusting eyes while reading or adjusting eyes while looking at potential danger

## \[\[Optic chiasm]]

Nasal retina goes through optic chiasm and undergoes "decussation" to cross over to other side.
Temporal retina remains as is.

## Retinotopy

Neighbors in retina map to neighbors in LGN and they map to neighbors in visual cortex.

Since there are more ganglions near fovea, central image is overrepresented (magnified) in LGN and V1
