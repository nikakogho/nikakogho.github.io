Made of muscle fibers
Fast and slow fibers

Fast - contract fast, look white, use glycogen
Slow - contract for hours, look red, use oxygen

Muscle types:

* Smooth - internal organs, digestive/urinary/reproductive
* Cardiac - heart
* Skeletal - moves bones around joints

Moved by [[Neuromuscular Junction]]

Extrafusal fiber on outside, for movement, innervated by **alpha motoneurons**

Intrafusal fiber on inside, for sending signal to [[Central Nervous System]], innervated by **gamma motoneurons**

[[Monosynaptic Reflex]]

## Skeletal Muscle

Made of muscle fibers. Each fiber innervated by a single axon from [[Central Nervous System]]

These muscles and their controlling neurons together are called **somatic motor system** because their control is voluntary.

Biceps and triceps are antagonists because biceps are for flexion and triceps for extension

Always done by **lower motor neurons** that originate from ventral (lower) horn in [[Spinal Cord]] (dorsal horn is for sensory input going up to brain)

Arms controlled mostly at C3-T1, legs at L1-S3.
These areas look bloated because they control more muscles

## Muscles By Anatomical Location

* Axial - posture
* Proximal (girdle) - shoulders/knees - for moving
* Distal - hands/feet, for manipulation

## Alpha Motor Neurons

Innervate muscles directly. Alpha motor neuron + its muscle fibers are called **Motor Unit**.

**Motor Neuron Pool** is a muscle and alpha motor neurons that innervate it

### Muscle Strength Control

CNS controls muscle strength by controlling firing rate and also by progressively recruiting more alpha motor neurons. First to activate are ones that control few muscle fibers and so have more fine control. This is why fine control is easier under light load

### Inputs

* mostly interneurons from spinal cord
* some from [[Brain Stem]] for voluntary movement
* some from **muscle spindles** to get muscle length data

### Release of Ca<sup>2+</sup>

Depolarization of SR causes release of Ca<sup>2+</sup> into cytosol of muscle fiber
