## Stretch Reflex

AKA myotatic reflex

When muscle is pulled (stretched), this reflex makes it contract to bring back to initial state

### Knee-Jerk Reflex

Type of stretch reflex used to check that knee muscle neurons work fine:

1. Doctor hits knee with small hammer
2. This causes quad muscles to slightly stretch
3. Muscle spindles detect this and generate action potential through Ia axon
4. Ia axon synapses on Alpha motor neuron
5. Alpha motor neuron causes muscle to contract

## Crossed-Extensor Reflex

When you reflexively lift a leg to escape pain, you get unbalanced and would fall if nothing happened. This is fixed by a reflex that activates more strain on the opposite leg in the opposite way. This is very important for [[Walking|walking]]
