Control posture of trunk and antigravity muscles of limbs for better [[Movement|movement]]

Originate from [[Reticular Formation]] of [[Brain Stem]] consisting of pontine (medial) and medullary (lateral) reticulospinal tracts

Pontine and medullary tracts have opposite jobs and are balanced by signals from upper layers

## Pontine Reticulospinal Tract

Enhances antigravity reflexes of [[Spinal Cord]]

## Medullary Reticulospinal Tract

Frees antigravity muscles from reflex control
