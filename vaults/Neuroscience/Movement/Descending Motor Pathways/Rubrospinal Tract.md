A descending motor pathway for lateral [[Movement|movement]], along with [[Corticospinal Tract]]

Regulating muscle tone and posture.
Has a smaller job in human nervous system compared to other animals, as in humans the corticospinal tract took a lot of its function.

Originates in right [[Red Nucleus]] of [[Midbrain]]

## Pathway

0. Red Nucleus
1. Decussates in [[Pons]]
2. [[Medulla oblongata]], similar path as corticospinal tract from here
3. Rubrospinal tract part of [[Spinal Cord]]
4. dorsolateral regions of ventral horn and intermediate grey matter
