A descending motor pathway for lateral [[Movement|movement]], along with [[Rubrospinal Tract]]

Fine details in hands and feet

Starts in [[Neocortex]]

Longest and one of the biggest of [[Central Nervous System|CNS]] tracts at 1 million axons

2/3 of axons come from [[Motor Cortex]], rest from [[Somatosensory Cortex]] in [[Parietal lobe]] to regulate flow of somatosensory input to brain

## Pathway

0. Neocortex
1. [[Internal Capsule|internal capsule]]
2. [[Thalamus|thalamus]]
3. base of [[Cerebral Peduncle|cerebral peduncle]] (a large group of axons in [[Midbrain|midbrain]])
4. [[Pons|pons]]
5. collect at the base of [[Medulla oblongata|medulla]] called **medullary pyramid** AKA **pyramidal tract** -> decussation (switching sides)
6. lateral column of [[Spinal Cord]] in corticospinal tract
7. dorsolateral regions of ventral horn and intermediate grey matter, where distal muscles (mostly flexors) are controlled
