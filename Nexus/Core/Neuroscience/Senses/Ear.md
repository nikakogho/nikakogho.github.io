For [[Hearing]]
Air enters in **external ear**, it blows on drumstick in **middle ear**, producing drums that cause waves in **inner ear** (made of cochlea and vestibular system)

Cochlea has hairs that send audio data through [[Cranial Nerves|Cranial Nerve VIII]] through [[Thalamus]] into [[Auditory Cortex]]

**Eustachian tube** connects air in middle ear to [[Nose|nasal cavity]]

* mostly closed
* opens when yawning/swallowing and equalizes pressure with environment to stop pain from say changing heights

## External ear

Air enters through **pinna**, goes through ear canal, and hits eardrum where external ear ends (eardrum mostly counts as part of middle ear)

Ear horn + ear canal increase magnitude of sound. That’s why big artificial ear horns help with hearing.
It also decreases magnitude of sound for frequencies outside human speech (human speech is 250-4000 Hz)

## Middle ear

Turn airblow on eardrum into signal for inner ear
**Ossicles**

* Malleus (hammer) - gets first signal
* Incus (anvil) - takes signal from malleus and gives to stapes
* Stapes - sends signal into oval window, applying pressure to fluid filled cochlea

**Tympanic membrane** is 15x wider than oval window area to prevent audio loss.

**Stapedius** is a muscle that pulls back stapes if voice is too high so that next high voice won’t hurt - **attenuation reflex**

## Inner ear

Tube of cochlea is 3 parallel tubes called *Scalae*: Scala vestibuli at top, Scala media in middle and Scala tympani at the bottom

Bottom and middle sections separated by basilar membrane, top and middle by Reissner's membrane, and in the middle we also have tectorial membrane (which likely plays a role in frequency selectivity setting for Organ of Corti)

In the middle we also have Stria vascularis (extracts potassium chloride from capillaries to maintain electrochemical gradient needed to spike at right sounds) and Organ of Corti (which has the auditory receptor neurons)

Tube is 22mm long and 2mm in diameter

Has oval window that gets input from middle ear and round window that vibrates opposite to oval window's input, allowing movement of fluid in ear

### Endocochlear potential

Scala vestibuli and Scala tympani have **perilymph**, which, like **cerebrospinal fluid**, has low K<sup>+</sup> and high Na<sup>+</sup>
Scala media has **endolymph**, which is low Na<sup>+</sup> and high K<sup>+</sup>, supported by active transport from stria vascularis => endolymph has 80 mV more electrical potential than perilymph, called **endocochlear potential**

### Cochlea

Chain of cilia
3D spiral
When pushed enough, opens [[Ion channel]]

**Tonotopy** - higher frequencies terminate faster and lower ones go farther so frequency is encoded by distance. This applies in cochlea, in MGN of Thalamus and in Auditory Cortex

#### Organ of Corti

Hair cells that each have 10-300 **stereocilia** on top. They are not neurons but their bending eventually results in spikes

Hair cells synapse on **spiral ganglions** whose axons make up [[Cranial Nerves|vestibulocochlear nerve (Cranial Nerve VIII)]]

Inner hair cells (between **modiolus** and **Rods of Corti**) that do 95% of the job and outer hair cells outside that mostly take data from other cells

Spiral ganglion each takes input from one inner hair cell or multiple outer hair cells, meaning inners are paid more attention

### Stereocilia bending

Basilar membrane moves in response to fluid moving, which causes tectorial membrane to also move, and as it holds stereocilia tips they bend, causing hair cells to polarize or depolarize, depending on direction

![Pasted_image_20250402092140.png](pasted_image_20250402092140.png)
Small sound moves cilia by 3nm (size of some atoms), strong sound moves by 20nm

#### Characteristic Frequency

Each hair cell is responsive to a particular frequency the most, called its **characteristic frequency**, and is less responsive to others
![Pasted_image_20250402101452.png](pasted_image_20250402101452.png)

### Bending to Spike

Hair cells have ion channels that open in response to bending, allowing ion flow into hair cell so they eventually spike and [[Synapse]] by sending [[Glutamate]] to spiral ganglions

![Pasted_image_20250402093040.png](pasted_image_20250402093040.png)

Interesting: opening K<sup>+</sup> causes hyperpolarization in most neurons, but because of high concentration in ear endolymph, here it flows in and depolarizes

### Outer hair cells as sound amplifiers

Outer hair cells have motor proteins called **prestin**

A chemical **furosemide** can mess with prestin working in outer hair cells, making ears 100 times less sensitive to sound

### Vestibule

Part of [[Vestibular System]]
