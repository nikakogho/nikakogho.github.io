For [[Vision]]

Light enters cornea -> aqueous humor -> lens -> vitreous (jelly like) humor -> retina -> Lateral Geniculate Nucleus of [[Thalamus]] -> [[Visual Cortex]]

Iris gives color
Zonule fibers attach lens to ciliary muscle
Relaxing ciliary muscle gives far vision, contracting gives near vision

Refraction is mostly in cornea since that's when light goes from air to water

## Retina

Rod and cone photoreceptors
![Pasted_image_20250305124647.png](pasted_image_20250305124647.png)

Inner nuclear layer - cell bodies of bipolar and amacrine cells
Outer nuclear layer - cell bodies of rods and cones

Pigmented epithelium protects rods and cones

Animals have a **reflective tapetum** below photoreceptors to get better darkness vision by compromising quality (acuity)

Central part is **macula**, where most cones are. Includes **fovea**

## Photoreceptors

Rods for darkness vision (**scotopic**)
Cones for [[Vision#Color Vision|color vision]] and in very lit situation (**photopic**)

Normal (**mesopic**) condition engages both

Average retina has 5 million cones and 92 million rods
Rods and cones mostly similar except for outer segment
Rods 1000x more light-sensitive

**Duplex retina** - rods and cones are basically 2 different vision systems. Some animals only have 1

### Cone types

S M L for short medium long
same as blue green red

S (blue) max stimulation at 430 nm wavelength
M (green) at 530 nm
L (red) at 560 nm

## Retina to LGN

Rod and cone photoreceptors -> bipolar cells -> ganglion cells -> [[Cranial Nerves|optic nerve]]
Only ganglion cells [[Spike|spike]]
Mostly only rods and cones are light-sensitive, but rarely also ganglion cells (likely doesn't matter)
**Horizontal cells** help photoreceptors talk to bipolar cells
**Amacrine cells** help bipolar cells talk to other amacrines, other bipolars and ganglion cells

## Fovea

Pit in retina made of lots of cones, no rods
Most of cones are in fovea, and then amount diminishes farther you go
