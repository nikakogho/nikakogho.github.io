Some animals are monogamous, some are polygamous (1 male with many females or rarely 1 female with many males), some are “one-night-stand” type deals.
Some animals stay to raise the kid, some abandon the kid quickly.
In some animals both parents raise the child, in most just the mother raises, rarely just the father raises.

Humans do all of these but for the most part are mostly monogamous.

Voles have 2 extreme cases:

* Prairie voles are monogamous and raise kids together
* Montane voles do one night stands and don’t care for partners or kids

## Vasopressin, The Loyalty Hormone

[[Vasopressin]], which is normally about water balance regulation, is also a [[Neuropeptide]] involved in making staying with the partner more preferable in many animals, even humans.

In voles

* Blocking vasopressin → males stop showing partner preference.
* Adding vasopressin or genetically increasing its receptors → even non-monogamous voles become more loyal.
