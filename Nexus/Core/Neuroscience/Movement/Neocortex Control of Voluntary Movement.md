Depends on where body is in space, where it wants to go, selection of plan for getting there, holding that plan in memory, and issuing instructions through [[Motor Cortex]] to go through with that plan

Premotor area (PMA) receives order to go through with the prepared movement from a part of **ventral lateral (VL)** nucleus in [[Thalamus]] called VL<sub>0</sub>, which itself is supplied by globus pallidus (GPi) of [[Basal Ganglia]]

## Direct Pathway

0. [[Frontal lobe]]
1. Striatum ([[Caudate Nucleus]] + [[Putamen]])
2. GPi
3. VL<sub>0</sub>
4. Supplementary Motor Area (SMA)

## Indirect Pathway

Inhibits movement
