Made of muscle fibers
Fast and slow fibers

Fast - contract fast, look white, use glycogen
Slow - contract for hours, look red, use oxygen

Muscle types:

* Smooth - internal organs, digestive/urinary/reproductive
* Cardiac - heart
* Skeletal - moves bones around joints

Moved by [[Neuromuscular Junction]]

Uses [[Neurotransmitter]] [[Acetylcholine]] (ACh)

Extrafusal fiber on outside, for movement, innervated by **alpha motoneurons**

Intrafusal fiber on inside, for sending signal to [[Central Nervous System]], innervated by **gamma motoneurons**

[[Monosynaptic Reflex]]

## Skeletal Muscle

Made of muscle fibers. Each fiber innervated by a single axon from [[Central Nervous System]]
![IMG_5460.jpeg](img_5460.jpeg)

These muscles and their controlling neurons together are called **somatic motor system** because their control is voluntary.

Biceps and triceps are antagonists because biceps are for flexion and triceps for extension
![IMG_5461.jpeg](img_5461.jpeg)

Always done by **lower motor neurons** that originate from ventral (lower) horn in [[Spinal Cord]] (dorsal horn is for sensory input going up to brain)
![IMG_5463.jpeg](img_5463.jpeg)

Arms controlled mostly at C3-T1, legs at L1-S3.
These areas look bloated because they control more muscles

## Muscles By Anatomical Location

* Axial - posture
* Proximal (girdle) - shoulders/knees - for moving
* Distal - hands/feet, for manipulation

## Alpha Motor Neurons

Innervate muscles directly. Alpha motor neuron + its muscle fibers are called **Motor Unit**.

**Motor Neuron Pool** is a muscle and alpha motor neurons that innervate it

### Muscle Strength Control

CNS controls muscle strength by controlling firing rate and also by progressively recruiting more alpha motor neurons. First to activate are ones that control few muscle fibers and so have more fine control. This is why fine control is easier under light load

### Inputs

* mostly interneurons from spinal cord
* some from [[Brain Stem]] for voluntary movement
* some from **muscle spindles** to get muscle length data

## Muscle Fiber

### Release of Ca<sup>2+</sup>

Depolarization of SR causes release of Ca<sup>2+</sup> into cytosol of muscle fiber
![IMG_5502.jpeg](img_5502.jpeg)

### Sarcomeres

Muscle fiber is made of sarcomeres, where each sarcomere is 2 z lines on top and bottom, thin filaments on edges and thick filaments in middle. Muscle contraction means thin filaments getting closer (also brings z lines closer)
![IMG_5538.jpeg](img_5538.jpeg)

Thin filament has **actin**, thick has **myosin**. At rest actin is covered by **tropopin** and **tropomyosin**, preventing thin and thick filamwnts from binding.

When Ca<sup>2+</sup> enters, it binds to tropopin and shifts tropomyosin, which now binds to myosin and moves, then after calcium reuptake by **sarcoplasmic reticulum** (which needs ATP) it lets go and so step by step muscle contracts

## Muscle Excitation-Contraction Steps

### Excitation

1. Action potential in alpha motor neuron
2. ACh released on neuromuscular junction
3. Nicotinic receptor channels open in sarcolemma, EPSP
4. Voltage-gated sodium channels open in sarcolemma, action potential made in muscle fiber
5. Action potential sweeps down the sarcolemma and enters T tubules
6. Depolarisation of T tubules releases Ca<sup>2+</sup> from SR

### Contraction

1. Ca<sup>2+</sup> binds to tropopin
2. Tropomyosin shifts
3. Myosin binding sites on actin exposed
4. Myosin head binds actin
5. Myosin heads pivot
6. ATP binds to myosin heads
7. myosin heads disengage from actin
8. Repeat as long as Ca<sup>2+</sup> and ATP present

### Relaxation

0. EPSPs end
1. Sarcolemma and T tubules return to resting potential
2. Calcium removed by SR and pump
3. Myosin binding sites on actin again covered by tropomyosin

## Muscle Spindles

For proprioception of muscles, uses Ia axons (largest and quickest type) wrapped around special skeletal muscles that stretch along with the main muscle and send the message to CNS so it can adjust with [[Reflex|Stretch Reflex]]
![IMG_5540.jpeg](img_5540.jpeg)

## Gamma Motor Neurons

As Alpha motor neurons innervate extrafusal muscle fibers (for movement), gamma motor neurons innervate intrafusal muscle fibers (spindles)
![IMG_5542.jpeg](img_5542.jpeg)

### Function

* a) Start state
* b) Activated alpha motor neuron shortener extrafusal fibers, also made spindles shortened
* c) Gamma motor neurons stretch back the spindles so they can register again
  ![IMG_5543.jpeg](img_5543.jpeg)

## Golgi Tendon Organ

Another type of muscle proprioception. Unlike spindles, Golgi tendon organ is in series with extrafusal fibers and uses Ib axons. Ia axons encode muscle **length**, Ib axons encode muscle **tension**.
![IMG_5544.jpeg](img_5544.jpeg)

Ib axons synapse on inhibitory interneurons to regulate muscle tension in a feedback loop
![IMG_5545.jpeg](img_5545.jpeg)

## Proprioception from Joints

Some proprioception also comes from mechanoreceptors in joints and ligaments, but people who replace those with metal parts can still tell their joint angles so all the proprioception data must be merging in CNS with some redundancy

## Reciprocal inhibition between flexors and extensors

Activation of biceps inhibits triceps and vice-versa
