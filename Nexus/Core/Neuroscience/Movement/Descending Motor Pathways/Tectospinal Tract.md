Descending ventromedial motor pathway for balance, along with [[Vestibulospinal Tracts]]

## Pathway

0. Superior [[Colliculus]] (optic tectum) in [[Midbrain]] receives direct input from [[Eye#Retina|retina]], from [[Visual Cortex]], [[Somatosensory Cortex]] and [[Auditory Cortex]]
1. Superior Colliculus constructs a map of the world
2. Orients head and eyes to move to the needed place
3. After colliculus, axons decussate and project into cervical regions of spinal cord to control neck, upper trunk and shoulders
