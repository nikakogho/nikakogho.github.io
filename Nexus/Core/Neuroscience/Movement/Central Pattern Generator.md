Automatic, rhythmic [[Movement|movement]] in absence of input

Walking, breathing, flying, swimming

Modifiable to do different function

## Rhythmic movement in spinal interneurons

a) NMDA receptor and Calcium-activated potassium channels closed at rest
b) [[Glutamate]] opens NMDA channel, so Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> flow into cell
c) Calcium opens potassium channel and K<sup>+</sup> flows out, which hyperpolarizes the membrane, allowing Mg<sup>2+</sup> to enter and clog the MMDA channel
d) repeat
