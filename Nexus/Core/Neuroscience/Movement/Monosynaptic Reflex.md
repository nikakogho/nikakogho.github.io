Type of [[Reflex]]
AKA stretch reflex (because stretch starts it)
etch reflex (because stretch starts it)

1. [[Muscles|intrafusal fiber]] is **stretched** 
2. it triggers a sensor [[Neuron]] wrapped around it
3. this neuron [[Synapse|synapses]] on a motoneuron in [[Spinal Cord]]
4. the motoneuron has [[Neuromuscular Junction]] on alpha neuron affecting extrafusal fiber of same muscle, making it **contract**, and also on gamma neuron affecting same intrafusal fiber

Self adjustment of muscle
Takes few milliseconds

**Gamma reflex loop** - [[Cerebellum]] can also affect gamma neuron and therefore trigger this
