Neural oscillation

Overall frequency at which oscillations in membrane potential in [[Neuron]] or [[Spike|spikes]] occur in [[Central Nervous System]]
Measured in Hz

Neurons often get synchronized for a specific task so they get same firing rate which we measure

- 0.5 - 4 Hz - Delta Waves - deep sleep. Arise in [[Thalamus]] or cortex
- 4 - 10 Hz - Theta Waves (theta rhythms) - in [[Hippocampus]], REM sleep
- 8-12 Hz - Alpha Waves ("Berger's Waves") - relaxed
- 12.5 - 30 Hz - Beta Waves - thinking, doing stuff
	- 12.5 - 16 Hz - Low Beta or "Beta 1"
	- 16.5 - 20 Hz - Beta or "Beta 2"
	- 20.5 -28 Hz - High Beta or "Beta 3"
- 30 - 100 Hz - Gamma Waves - working memory, attention, grouping ideas
