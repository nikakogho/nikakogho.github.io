Let [[Neurotransmitter]] be sent to *presynaptic membrane* by fusing vesicle to it
v-SNARE on vesicle binds to t-SNAREs on terminal membrane to cause *fusion* and create opening for neurotransmitters
Fusion happens when Ca<sup>2+</sup> is high enough, caused by action potential opening the calcium [[Ion channel]]
**Membrane trafficking**
