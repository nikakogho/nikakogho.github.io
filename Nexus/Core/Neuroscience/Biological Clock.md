Inner sense of time in organs. Needed for [[Circadyan Rhythm]] and other purposes.

## Suprachiasmatic Nucleus

Sets the pace for

* [[Sleep]]-wake cycle
* Feeding
* Body temperature
* [[Hormone Production]]
* [[Autonomic Nervous System]]
* Cell and expression rhythm by sending neural and hormonal signals to every cell

Sleep cycles are set by [[Ultradian Rhythm]] though.

Right above [[Optic chiasm]], in the [[Hypothalamus]], mammals have a pair of neuron clusters suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN).
It receives light signals from ganglionic cells in [[Eye|retina]] (not rods nor cones, but ganglionic cells that are slowly sensitive to light due to photopigment **melanopsin** and synapse directly on SCN).
