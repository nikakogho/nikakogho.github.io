Problem with [[Memory]]

Retrograde memories (before trauma) are generally ok
Anterograde memories (new stuff after trauma) can't be formed

## Classic Amnesia
Trouble forming new memories + forgetting some weak memories of past like recent stuff

## Anterograde Amnesia
Can't form new memories

## Retrograde Amnesia
Past memories slowly go away one by on, starting with recent, less consolidated ones and moving back deeper
