Self-awareness, being conscious, qualia

Unclear how to measure ([[Hard Problem Of Consciousness]])

We know that [[Frontal lobe]] is strongly involved

Moral judgements likely need it

We know neural correlates but not the cause

Involved in qualia of [[Senses|senses]] and intention (choosing where to put [[Attention]], where to [[Movement|move]], what to say)

Also involved in [[Sense of Time]]

## Self

Sense of self is connected to consciousness but probably either can exist somewhat without the other
