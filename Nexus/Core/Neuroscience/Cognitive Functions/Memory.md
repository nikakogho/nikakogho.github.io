Change in [[Synapse]]

Short term "working memory" mostly in [[Prefrontal Cortex]]
Long term in [[Hippocampus]]

Made by [[Long Term Potentiation]] (LTP)

## Types
**Working** - 4-7 items thing
**Implicit** (procedural)
- walking
- pain
- reflexes
- emotional memories like fears and PTSD
- pattern recognition
- handled by [[Striatum]]
**Explicit (declarative)** - "I live at this address"
- Requires [[Hippocampus]] to create
- Semantic - "Tbilisi is capital of Georgia"
	- From hippocampus gets in [[Neocortex]] and eventually can be recalled from there directly
- Episodic  - "Yesterday we had a fight"
	- Also stored in neocortex but must go back to hippocampus for **reconsolidation** where they get edited and updated (potentially replaced with wrong data) upon each recall
	- Always requires hippocampus to recall

Episodic memory over time becomes semantic memory, because after retelling it enough times we end up remembering it as cold data of someone telling it, not as experience of living through it

## Long Term Memory Consolidation
Short term memories formed in hippocampus must eventually migrate to neocortex.
Mechanism for this involves new protein synthesis, and happens to memories that are tagged as **important**.

Consolidation happens mostly in sleep and starts with [[Sharp Wave Ripples]].
