Why do we feel things and have a subjective experience instead of blindly processing data?
Why do we feel the redness of red and pain of pain and so on instead of just receiving data and acting on it?

Why do we have [[Qualia]]?
How would we know it if one day an [[AI]] develops it?

## Proposed Solutions
1. Trace the thoughts of qualia we have all the way to origin
2. Unclear how hard this would be to do in a human but if we were to somehow train a [[Large Language Models|large language model]] without giving it any notion of qualia and then let it speak till it discovers it, we would just take a look inside its activations to see how it came up with qualia and we can assume that only those who have qualia can come up with it. Well this is a big hypothetical
