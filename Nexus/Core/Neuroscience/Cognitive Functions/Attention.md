Where we direct a higher level of processing, possibly at the expense of lowering the processing of other spots. There’s visual, spatial, other sensory attentions, or a more abstract one but either involves a bunch of areas including [[Prefrontal Cortex]].
Important for [[Consciousness]].

## Guiding Visual Attention

[[Thalamus]] has **pulvinar nucleus** that guides visual attention by directing [[Primary Visual Cortex|V1]], V4, other brain areas, and possibly also indirectly ordering where to move eyes

Thalamus also controls attention through **Thalamic Reticular Nucleus (TRN)** that decides what information to send over to neocortex. It is an **inhibitory** structure that decides what to **NOT** send through.

### Frontal Eye Fields

## Frontoparietal Attention Network

### Bottom-Up

Steps:
0\. Visual input received in V1 gets processed and moved up V2 -> V4 -> LIP

1. LIP constructs [[Salience Map]] of object and send the map to FEF
2. FEF talks to prefrontal cortex and motor cortex to decide eye movement and focus

### Top-Down

Steps:
0\. Prefrontal cortex and FEF decide what to care about

1. All the rest repeats in reverse
