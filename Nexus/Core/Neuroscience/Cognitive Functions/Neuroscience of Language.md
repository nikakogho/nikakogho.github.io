* Producing speech is mostly in [[Broca’s Area]]
* Understanding speech mostly in [[Wernicke’s Area]]
* But they share a lot of tasks

Dominant hemisphere (left for most people) has Broca's and Wernicke's areas, but in some people it's in right hemisphere or even bilateral. Typically the non-dominant side handles **prosody** (picking up on cues like smile, tone...)

This difference also shows in **planum temporale** of Wernicke's area
