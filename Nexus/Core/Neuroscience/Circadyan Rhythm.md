Day-night cycling of chemical concentrations, body temperature, [[Sleep]] and bunch of other things in the body.

Each body part has its own [[Biological Clock]] that is periodically fixed by light to readjust to 24 hour cycle (may drift to 25-36 hours without signal).

It controls
- falling asleep (but not sleep cycles, those are controlled by [[Ultradian Rhythm]])
- eating
- body temperature
- [[Hormone Production]]
- [[Autonomic Nervous System]]
- Cell and gene expression
