MRI

Better contrast between tissue types than in [[Computer Tomography|CT]]
Uses magnetic field which causes hydrogen in body to realign. Nuclei of atoms produces magnetic field which computer reads and produces image from.
Brain is scanned every 2-3 seconds.

Good for detail, too slow for fast events, opposite of [[Electro Encephalography|EEG]] and [[Magnetic Encephalography|MEG]]
