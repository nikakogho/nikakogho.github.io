Linked to speech along with [[Broca’s Area]]
Comprehension of written and spoken language
In Brodmann area 22 in [[Temporal Lobe|superior temporal gyrus]] in dominant hemisphere

Works with *primary auditory cortex*, Broca’s area and angular gyrus in [[Parietal lobe]] to integrate audio data with linguistic knowledge

Left hemisphere has a larger **planum temporale** in Wernicke's area and may be why left side gets to be dominant often
