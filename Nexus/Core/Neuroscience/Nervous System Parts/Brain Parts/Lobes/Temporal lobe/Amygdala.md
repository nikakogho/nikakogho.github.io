![amygdala_parts.jpeg](amygdala_parts.jpeg)
Made of

* Basolateral nuclei - receive sensory input from sensory cortices, [[Thalamus]], and [[Hippocampus]], for emotional conditioning
* Corticomedial nuclei - take [[Olfactory Cortex|olfactory]] input, involved in arousal
* Central nucleus - output center of amygdala, projects to [[Hypothalamus]] and [[Brain Stem]] to control autonomic, endocrine and behavioral responses

## Pathways To Hypothalamus

* Fast (for rapid responses) - [[Ventral Amygdalofugal Pathway]], from basolateral and central nuclei to lateral hypothalamus and brainstem
* Slow (hormonal and sustained emotional regulation) - [[Stria Terminalis]], from central and medial nuclei to medial hypothalamus

## Learned Fear

Sound becomes associated with shock and then only sound gives same fear response
