For memory and learning and spatial navigation
In each [[Temporal lobe]]

Stores memories when awake and transfers them to long term memory in [[Neocortex]] during sleep when triggered by [[Sharp Wave Ripples]].

Stores spatial memories particularly well because of place cells, grid cells and other spatial optimized neurons. This is why memory palaces work: they bypass working memory and go straight in hippocampus in a more stable storage

## How Memories Form

At first hippocampus stores the whole thing, and in sleep starts to offload the main content to neocortex while keeping keys to each place line index

What happens after has 2 ideas and we’re not fully sure yet which is right:

1. Standard Model - over time neocortex takes over the indexing role and hippocampus fully stops participating ![standard_model_hippocampus.jpeg](standard_model_hippocampus.jpeg)
2. Multiple Trace Model - episodic memory must be retraced through hippocampus on every recall, but semantic memory is done fully by neocortex after a while![multiple_trace_model_hippocampus.jpeg](multiple_trace_model_hippocampus.jpeg)
   1. Long term episodic memories become semantic memories and so get stored in neocortex
