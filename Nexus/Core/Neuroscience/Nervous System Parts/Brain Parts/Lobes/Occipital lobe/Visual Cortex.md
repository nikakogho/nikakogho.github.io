In [[Occipital lobe]]
For [[Vision]]
Visual data goes from eye to optic nerve to Lateral Geniculate Nucleus in [[Thalamus]] to visual cortex

After receiving in V1, it is moved through ventral pathway for "what" and dorsal pathway for "where" understanding

If dorsal fails, can cause **visual agnosia** - person sees every piece but can't assemble into full form to say if he's looking at a person or what
**Prosopagnosia** - can't tell faces

## V1 - [[Primary Visual Cortex]]

AKA **striate cortex**
Takes input from LGN, and sends back even more than retina does

## V2 - secondary visual cortex

Input from V1
Contours, textures, combining basics
Outline of object

## V3

Input from V2
Form and motion, moving and changing shapes

## V4

Input from V1 and V2
Color and objects
Can detect specific colors and shapes like wheels or windows

## V5 - MT or Middle Temporal Area

Input from V2, V3, and V1's layer IVB
Motion perception
Detects direction and speed of moving objects
Almost all neurons direction sensitive

## MST - Medial Superior Temporal

Cells selective for linear, radial and circular motion

## Higher

**Inferotemporal cortex (IT)** takes V1-V5 data to consciously recognize that we're looking at a moving car

## Ventral Stream - "what"

V1 -> V2 -> V4 -> IT

## Dorsal Stream - "where"

V1 -> V2 -> V3 -> V5 -> parietal areas
Tracking movement
