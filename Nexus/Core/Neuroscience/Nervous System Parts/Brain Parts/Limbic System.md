AKA *paleomammalian cortex*

Group of brain parts that regulate emotion and behaviour

![Pasted_image_20241125122753.png](pasted_image_20241125122753.png)

* [[Fornix]] - below [[Corpus Callosum]], communication pathway to limbic system for hippocampus and others
* [[Olfactory bulb]] (sometimes counted) - processes smell, can trigger emotional memories. Right above nasal cavity
* [[Amygdala]]
  * in [[Temporal lobe]]
  * processes fear, anger, pleasure
  * emotional memory and decision making
* In cerebrum
  * [[Hippocampus]] - in temporal lobe for new long term memory and spatial navigation
  * [[Cingulate gyrus]] (Cingulate Cortex) - emotional regulation, pain processing, links behavioral outcomes to motivation
    * arches around Corpus callosum
  * [[Parahippocampal gyrus]] - surrounds hippocampus, involved in memory processing, spatial navigation, emotion encoding
* In [[Diencephalon]] - processing sensory and motor signals, regulating autonomous functions, coordinating endocrine activity
  * [[Thalamus]] - in center of brain, near top of [[Brain Stem]], relay station for sensory data except smell
  * [[Hypothalamus]]
    * below thalamus, near base of brain
    * regulates homeostasis
    * connects emotional responses to physiological states
  * [[Mamillary bodies]] - recollective and spatial memory
    * at base of brain, part of hypothalamus
