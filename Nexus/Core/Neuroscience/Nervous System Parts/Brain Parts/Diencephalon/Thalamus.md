Relay center of the nervous system

Grey matter in forebrain
Part of [[Diencephalon]]
Between cerebral cortex and [[Midbrain]]
Relays sensory and motor signals to cerebral cortex
Regulates consciousness, sleep and alertness

Lateral hypothalamus - hunger for food, for information, for things

## Lateral Geniculate Nucleus

For conscious perception of [[Vision]]
Takes data from [[Cranial Nerves|optic nerves]] and connects to [[Visual Cortex]]
Also takes data (80% in fact) from [[Primary Visual Cortex]]

6 layers of neurons

### LGN structure

![Pasted_image_20250309071958.png](pasted_image_20250309071958.png)
For each side of LGN, layers 2 3 5 from same side eye, 1 4 6 from other side eye
Each layer only works with 1 eye

Left LGN gets right visual field data from left temporal and right nasal
Right LGN gets left visual data from right temporal and left nasal

Layers 1 and 2 are M type ganglion extensions (big)
Layers 3-6 are P type ganglion extensions (small)

**Koniocellular LGN layers** - 6 K layers also exist under each main one, same side of eye as overlaying one, for nonM-nonP ganglions

Same receptive fields as in [[Vision#Ganglions|ganglions]]:

* Magnocellular LGN neurons have large center-surround fields and respond to stimuli with burst that goes away, and don't care about wavelength (color)
* Parvocellular LGN have smaller center-surround fields, respond with sustained excitation, and care for color
* Koniocellular LGN neurons are center-surround and have light/dark or blue vs yellow or red vs green or other color opponency
