At base of brain below [[Hypothalamus]]

Releases hormones, controls endocrine system

Sits in chamber called *Sella turcica*

## Anterior Lobe

Is a gland.
Controlled by hypothalamus’ **periventricular area**’s **parvocellular neurosecretory cells** that talk to it via bloodstream, by secreting **hypophysiotropic hormones** in uniquely specialized capillary bed at the floor of third [[Ventricles|ventricle]], called **hypothalamo-pituitary portal circulation**.

Makes hormones:

* Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH or corticotrophin) - body response to stress, stimulates adrenal glands to make cortisol
* Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) - stimulates producing sperm in males, estrogen in females (gonadotrophic hormone)
* Growth Hormone (GH)
* Luteinizing Hormone (LH) - stimulates ovulation in females, testosterone in males
* Prolactin - stimulates lactation (breast milk production) after giving birth
* Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) - stimulates thyroid to make thyroid hormones for managing metabolism

### Stress Response

## Posterior Lobe

Is a real brain part.

Hypothalamus has **magnocellular neurosecretory cells** that extend axons into posterior lobe and release these **neurohormones** directly into its capillaries:

* Antidiuretic hormone (ADH) (Vasopressin) - water balance and sodium levels
* Oxytocin - helps labor in females, causes breastmilk flow, helps parent and child bond. Moves sperm for males
