Small
Contains some [[Nucleus|nuclei]] with different functions

Below [[Thalamus]]
Part of [[Limbic System]]
Part of [[Diencephalon]]

## Functions

* Link nervous and endocrine systems with [[Pituitary Gland]], secretes hormones to control endocrine system
* Maintains homeostasis, fight or flight responses, rest-and-digest functions
* Energy balance
* Water balance
* Circadyan rhytms and sleep cycle
* Emotion/behavior regulation
* Releases **GnRH** that releases sex hormones (estrogen or testosterone) from gonads
* Processing pain and pleasure
* Plays part in memory together with [[Hippocampus]] via [[Mamillary bodies]]

## Zones

Lateral, medial, periventricular

### Periventricular

Except for **supraoptic nucleus** that is displaced laterally by optic tract, all other cells are right next to third [[Ventricles|ventricle]].

Cells here:

* Supraciasmatic Nucleus (SCN) - just above [[Optic chiasm]], for regulating cyrcadian rhytm with day-night cycle by retinal input
* Some control [[Autonomic Nervous System]] (ANS)
* Others are **neurosecretory neurons**, and extend axons down to pituitary

## Problems

Its dysfunction can cause obesity, sleep problems, diabetes, etc

## Talking to Kidney

More **vasopressin** the hypothalamus releases through the pituitary, the more water kidneys can reabsorb and keep blood pressure high. But under low blood pressure:
0\. kidneys secrete **renin** into bloodstream

1. Liver makes **angiotensinogen**
2. They react and form angiotensin I
3. Breaks down into angiotensin II
4. **Subfornical organ** that doesnâ€™t have [[Blood-Brain Barrier]] detects it and tells hypothalamus to increase vasopressin production and give feeling of thirst
