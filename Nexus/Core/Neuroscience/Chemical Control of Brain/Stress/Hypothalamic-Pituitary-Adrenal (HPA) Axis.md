Regulates secreting [[Cortisol]] from [[Adrenal Glands]] in [[Stress Response|response to stress]].

Increased by [[Amygdala]], decreased by [[Hippocampus]].
![amygdala_hippocampus_hpa.jpeg](amygdala_hippocampus_hpa.jpeg)

Steps:
0\. Brain perceives threat -> [[Hypothalamus|hypothalamus]] is activated

1. Hypothalamus releases CRH (Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone)
   1. Travels through **hypophyseal portal system** (in blood) and goes to [[Pituitary Gland]]
2. Anterior pituitary gland receives CRH, and in response secretes ACTH (Adrenocorticotropic Hormone)
3. ACTH goes through general bloodstream and arrives at adrenal glands
4. ACTH reaches **adrenal cortex**, outside of adrenal glands
5. Adrenal cortex releases **cortisol**
6. Cortisol travels through body and
   1. Mobilizes energy
   2. Increases blood sugar
   3. Sharpens focus
   4. Suppresses non-critical functions like digestion and immune system
7. Some cortisol returns to hypothalamus and pituitary, and when enough are received, they know the body doesn't need more and they stop secreting CRH and ACTH
