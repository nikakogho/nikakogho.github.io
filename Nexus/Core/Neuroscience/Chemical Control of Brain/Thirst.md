Many similar mechanisms as with [[Hunger|hunger]].

Can be triggered by low blood volume or by [[Tonicity|hypertonicity]] (too much solute outside cells)

## Volumetric Thirst

Low blood volume causes **volumetric thirst**

## Hypertonicity

Detected in a part of telencephalon that lacks [[Blood-Brain Barrier]], called [[Vascular Organ of the Lamina Terminalis (OVLT)]].

In hypertonicity, water leaves cells by osmosis. OVLT detects this and

1. Excites neurosecretory magnocellular cells that secrete [[Vasopressin|vasopressin]]
2. Stimulates **osmometric thirst** - motivation to drink water when dehydrated

Osmometric Thirst

Lesions to OVLT prevent motivation to drink when dehydrated but don't prevent motivation to drink from low blood volume
