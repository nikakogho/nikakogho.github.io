Allow [[Serotonin]] and [[Norepinephrine]] to remain in [[Neuron|synaptic cleft]] for longer, either by blocking reuptake or by blocking their breakdown.
Also affect [[Dopamine]] by co-blocking dopamine reuptake when blocking norepinephrine reuptake and also from spillover effect where increase of serotonin and norepinephrine also increases dopamine.
As a result they regulate mood by affecting the [[Stress Response]], particularly [[Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) Axis]].
Strangely, it takes a couple weeks before their effect kicks in, we don't fully understand why.

SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) may also be helping [[Neurogenesis|neurogenesis]] in [[Hippocampus|hippocampus]].
