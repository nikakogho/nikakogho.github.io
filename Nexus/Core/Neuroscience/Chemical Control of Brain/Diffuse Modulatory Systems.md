Groups of neurons that control many others without changing their "personality", sort of like "bass" and "volume" settings in audio.

Each axon of diffuse modulatory system may synapse on and affect 100 000 neurons.
Their [[Synapse|synapses]] often release [[Neurotransmitter|neurotransmitters]] in extracellular fluid, affecting many neurons.

**Ascending reticular activating system** - noradrenergic locus coeruleus and serotonergic Raphe nuclei that increase arousal in face of new experiences.

## [[Stimulant Drugs]]

Like [[Cocaine]] or [[Amphetamine]].

## [[Hallucinogens]]

Like [[LSD]], [[Psilocybin]], [[DMT]].

## Noradrenergic Locus Coeruleus

Uses NE ([[Norepinephrine]]), which is a neurotransmitter in peripheral [[Autonomic Nervous System|ANS]], and also used by **locus coeruleus** in [[Pons|pons]].
Likely involved in increasing arousal and attention in face of new experiences.
We have 2 of those, 1 on each side, each made of 12 000 neurons.
Each neuron here makes about 250 000 synapses, anywhere from

* cerebral cortex
* [[Thalamus]]
* [[Hypothalamus]]
* [[Olfactory bulb]]
* [[Cerebellum]]
* [[Midbrain]]
* [[Spinal Cord]]

## Serotonergic Raphe Nuclei

[[Serotonin]]-containing neurons in 9 Raphe Nuclei. Raphe means "ridge" or "seem" and they are on sides of midlines of [[Brain Stem]].

Caudal parts near [[Medulla oblongata|medulla]] modulate pain-related sensory signals in spinal cord.
Rostral parts in pons and midbrain do arousal, just like locus coeruleus.

## Dopaminergic Substantia Nigra and Ventral Tegmental Area

[[Dopamine]] in [[Substantia Nigra]] in midbrain is to initiate movement by supplying dopamine to **striatum** ([[Caudate Nucleus]] + [[Putamen]]).
In [[Ventral Tegmental Area (VTA)]] it is called **mesocorticolimbic dopamine system** and innervates [[Frontal lobe]] and part of [[Limbic System]]. Likely involved in reward systems and some psychiatric disorders.

## Cholinergic Basal Forebrain and Brain Stem Complexes

[[Acetylcholine]] is most famous for being used in [[Neuromuscular Junction]] (to move), at synapses in autonomic ganglia, and at postganglionic parasympathetic synapses.

### Basal Forebrain Complex

Likely plays a role in memory, learning, attention, arousal.
Cholinergic neurons scattered medial and ventral to [[Basal Ganglia]].
They include

* Medial [[Septal Nuclei]]
* Basal nuclei of Meynert

### Pontomesencephalotegmental complex

In pons and midbrain.
Acts on dorsal thalamus and also regulates excitability of sensory relay.
They also project up to [[Neocortex|neocortex]] and link brain stem and basal forebrain complexes.
