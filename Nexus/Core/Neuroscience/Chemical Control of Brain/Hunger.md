Protein **leptin** is supposed to regulate how hungry we feel.

Body can decrease its sensitivity to leptin, which would be same as if we had leptin shortage, and it would cause urge to overeat and cause obesity.

Similarly, too high leptin can cause anorexia.

## Hypothalamus Effect

**Lateral hypothalamic syndrome** - bilateral lesion in lateral [[Hypothalamus]] causes anorexia.

**Ventromedial hypothalamic syndrome** - bilateral lesion in ventromedial hypothalamus causes overeating.

## Short-Term Regulation of Hunger

* Orexigenic signal tells you you are hungry
* Satiety signal tells you you had enough

During eating our body goes through 3 phases:

1. **Cephalic** - anticipation
   1. [[Parasympathetic Nervous System]] and [[Enteric Nervous System]] activate
   2. You get saliva in your mouth (wet surface makes swallowing easier)
   3. Digestive juices prepare in stomach
2. **Gastric** phase - responses get stronger as you chew and swallow
3. **Substrate** phase
   1. Stomach filled
   2. Partially digested food moves to intestines
   3. Nutrients start to be absorbed in bloodstream
