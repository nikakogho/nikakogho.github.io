At first embryo divides into endoderm, mesoderm and ectoderm
![IMG_4736.png](img_4736.png)

Part of ectoderm called **neuroectoderm** turns into **neural tube** through **neurulation**
![IMG_4739.jpeg](img_4739.jpeg)

Neural tube will form [[Central Nervous System]] and neural crest will form [[Peripheral Nervous System]]

## Neural tube into brain

Splits into forebrain ([[Telencephalon]] + [[Diencephalon]]), [[Midbrain]] and [[Hindbrain]]

Diencephalon becomes [[Thalamus]] and [[Hypothalamus]]

Telencephalon becomes cerebral cortex, [[Basal Ganglia]] and [[Amygdala]]

Telencephalon splits into hemispheres

## Neural Cell Proliferation

At first brain has ventricular zone and marginal zone. Each **neural progenitor** cell (specifically a **radial glial cell**, a type of multipotent [[Stem Cells|stem cell]]) here moves up to pial surface, then back down and divides. If split in equal parts, both remain to do more splits. If unequal, the above one moves up and stops dividing, becoming a neuron (the ones that stay eventually also stop dividing and become glia).

Notch-1 and Numb [[Transcription Factor|transcription factors]] determine this differentiation into neuron or glia.
![notch_and_numb_neuron_vs_glia.png](notch_and_numb_neuron_vs_glia.png)

Most neurons form between 5 weeks to 5 months, at 250 000 neurons per minute.

Humans also have an **Outer Subventricular Zone (OSVZ)** for forming the complex neocortex allowing abstract thought (dogs, cats, whales, kangaroos also have this. Mice probably also had it and lost it). This zone forms layers II and III of neocortex.

Neocortex is assembled inside-out, first layer VI then V then IV and so on

## Cortical Formation from Subplate

![cortical_layers_formation_subplate_order.png](cortical_layers_formation_subplate_order.png)
Subplate is formed first and used as scaffold, and disappears when the process is over. Cortical plate differentiates into all the layers from VI to I.
Subplate is also needed so that axons arriving from thalamus can synapse on subplate as a waiting zone before the layer IV neurons that they are meant for are formed.
Once layer IV is made, **handshake** happens - these axons are handed off from subplate to layer IV.

### Cortex Sizes are Controlled by Gradients of Transcription Factors

More Pax6 in anterior cortex, more Emx2 in posterior cortex.

* If mutant has less Emx2 then [[Motor Cortex]] gets bigger.
* If less Pax6 then [[Visual Cortex]] gets bigger.

## Forming Pyramidal Neurons

Protein **semaphorin 3A** repels soma but attracts dendrites of pyramidal neurons to give them characteristic shape
![pyramidal_neuron_formation.png](pyramidal_neuron_formation.png)

## Axon Formation

Steps:

1. Pathway selection - “go roughly this way”
2. Target selection - “land in LGN”
3. Address selection - “exactly here”

### Fasciculation

One axon binds to [[Extracellular Matrix]], next axons form a chain with CAMs

## Synapse Formation

Steps:

1. Dendritic filopodium contacts axon
2. Presynaptic membrane forms
3. Neurotransmitter receptors gather in postsynaptic site

### Neuromuscular Synapse Formation

[[Neuromuscular Junction]] has a slightly different synapse since receiving side is muscle
![neuromuscular_synapse_formation.jpeg](neuromuscular_synapse_formation.jpeg)

## Neuronal and Synaptic Pruning

Throughout fetal development and adolescence some neurons and synapses get deleted. This is sometimes called **synaptic pruning**.
![synaptic_pruning.jpeg](synaptic_pruning.jpeg)

### Synaptic Pruning In Muscle

Each motor unit must be innervated by a single alpha motor neuron but at first this is not the case
![synaptic_pruning_muscle_1.jpeg](synaptic_pruning_muscle_1.jpeg)

This effect can be used to reduce connections to muscle by blocking AchR ([[Acetylcholine]] receptor), after which the presynaptic side slowly gets removed
![synaptic_pruning_muscle_2.jpeg](synaptic_pruning_muscle_2.jpeg)

### Synaptic Rearrangement

![synaptic_rearrangement.jpeg](synaptic_rearrangement.jpeg)

#### Hebb Synapses

Hebbian learning “neurons that fire together, wire together” explains how even though at first LGN receives input from both eyes all around, it differentiates over time
![LGN_hebb_synapses.jpeg](lgn_hebb_synapses.jpeg)

### Autism

[[Autism]] is believed to be caused by not enough synaptic pruning, causing a kind of [[Overfitting]] in the brain that makes autistic people unusually good at some local tasks but poor at generalization and global integration. Too densely packed neurons also give them higher risk of [[Epilepsy|epilepsy]] due to action potential leakage between neurons (known as **crosstalk**).

#### Double Descent?

If autism is comparable to overfitting, then in cases when there is high enough amount of neurons and synapses there may be a **double descent** happening, as with savants. Essentially, the brain may be regaining certain or all abilities and pushing them to quite higher levels than baseline
