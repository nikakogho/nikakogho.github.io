Capacitor stores charge
Capacitance C = Q / V
Unit is Farad = Coulomb / Volt

## Dielectric

Insulator that can be polarized
Polarization means opposite charges of elements look at plates so total voltage decreases so capacitance increases

Since battery must still use same voltage, that means total charge now increases => capacitance increases
Depends on **dielectric constant** k > 1 and C<sub>after dielectric</sub> = k \* C<sub>before dielectric</sub>

## Series

Capacitors connected in series have same charge, and details of them can be found by taking an equivalent capacitor for which charge will be same and capacitance will be
1/C<sub>equivalent</sub> = 1/C<sub>1</sub> + 1/C<sub>2</sub> + ...

## Parallel

Same voltage, capacitance for equivalent summed up directly
C<sub>equivalent</sub> = C<sub>1</sub> + C<sub>2</sub> + ...
