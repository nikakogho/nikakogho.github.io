## Zeroth Law
If two systems are in thermal equilibrium with a third system, they are also with each other

## First Law
Internal energy of system = heat supplied to system from outside + work done by outside to system
ΔU<sub>system</sub> (internal energy) = Q + W

Generally
ΔU<sub>system</sub> (internal energy) + ΔE<sub>potential</sub> + ΔE<sub>kinetic</sub> = Q + W

W = ∫<sub>V1</sub><sup>V2</sup> P dV

## Second Law
[[Entropy]] tends to increase in isolated system. Explains why some things are irreversible and heat flows from hot to cold

## Third Law
As system approaches absolute 0, entropy approaches 0
