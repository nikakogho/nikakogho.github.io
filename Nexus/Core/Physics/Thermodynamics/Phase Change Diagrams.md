## Superheated Vapor

Vapor with temperature higher than saturation temperature => losing heat won't make it start condensation

## Compressed Liquid

Before reaching vapor temperature (100 degrees C)
In that transition specific volume doesn't change much.

## Saturated Liquid / Saturated Vapor

At 100 degrees, about to start boiling/condensing and become part liquid part vapor

## Boiling/Condensation

Vapor quality x = vapor mass / total mass
Temperature remains, specific volume changes until fully condensed or vaporized
Amount needed is [[Latent Heat]]
