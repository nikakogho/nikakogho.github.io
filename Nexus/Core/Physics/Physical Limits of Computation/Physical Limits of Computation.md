Approaches [[Computronium]], likely involving [[Black Hole]] computing as described in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09575) from Gia Dvali and Zaza Osmanov.

Set by:
- [[Landauer's Limit]] - minimum energy per irreversible bit flip
- [[Margolus-Levitin Bound]] - max distinct state changes per second per joule
	- "Clock speed of the universe"
- Light Speed - probably can't transmit data faster
- [[Bekenstein Bound]] - max bits that can be stored per kg per meter
- [[Bremermann's Limit]] - max computational speed per kg
- Atomic Density Limit - can't pack more than 10<sup>29</sup> atoms per m<sup>3</sup>
- Quantum Noise / Uncertainty Floor - [[Heisenberg Uncertainty]] and vacuum fluctuations mean some amount of error will necessarily slip in computation
	- 0 error computation is impossible
