Computation happens differently depending on [[Computer Architecture|architecture]].

Hardware Types:
- [[Transistor-Based Computing]]
	- [[CPU]] - sequential regular processing
	- [[RAM]] - random-access memory, used when running, clears on disable, works with CPU to get stuff done
	- [[GPU]] - in retrospect should've been called PPU (parallel processing unit), has many cores and does better for parallelizable tasks, originally gaming then crypto mining and now for training and running [[Large Language Models]]. Made and led by [[Nvidia]]
	- [[TPU]] - similar to GPU but optimized for linear algebra operations. Made and used by Google
- [[Vacuum-Tube Computing]] - computing of 40s up to 60s
- [[Quantum Computing|QPU]] - quantum computing
- [[Optical Computing]]
- [[Organoid Intelligence]]
- [[Neuromorphic Computing]] - goes against [[John von Neumann Architecture]]

Optimizing for best possible hardware eventually converges on [[Computronium|computronium]]
