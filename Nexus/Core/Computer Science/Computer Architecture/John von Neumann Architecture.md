Separate computing and storage that communicate via a bus.

Typically: [[CPU]] computes, [[RAM]] stores.

Today's machines use this architecture.

Human brain does not use this since a single [[Neuron|neuron]] both computes and stores information, and there are works in [[Neuromorphic Computing]] to make machines like that too, to save on time and energy spent in communication between CPU and RAM.
