Detailed kind of [[Virtualization]] where we run one OS on top of another.
VMWare and such let us run Linux on Windows, or MacOS on Windows on Linux on Windows etc.
Good for when you need security (due to cybersecurity work) or just a sandbox environment, or when you need access to terminal commands of another OS (mostly WSL is good enough for this though)
