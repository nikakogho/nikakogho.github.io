They tell [[Cell|cells]] in a [[Tissue|tissue]] to grow and [[Cell Differentiation|differentiate]] in some way.

## TGF-β Superfamily
Transforming Growth Factor-beta

Most important branches for [[Tissue Engineering]]:
- TGF-βs (e.g., TGF-β1, TGF-β3) - for cell proliferation, differentiation and [[Extracellular Matrix|ECM]] production. Very important to stimulate **chondrogenesis** (making of [[Chondrocyte|chondrocytes]])
- Bone Morphogenetic Proteins (BMP-2, BMP-7...) - **osteoinductive** ([[Bone|bone]]), they force unspecialized cells like Mesenchymal [[Stem Cells]] to differentiate into bone-forming [[Osteoblast|osteoblasts]]

## VEGF (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor)
Master regulator of [[Angiogenesis]] (forming new [[Blood Vessel|blood vessels]] from existing ones).
Stimulates proliferation, migration and survival of endothelial cells that line blood vessels

## FGF (Fibroblast Growth Factor)
Like bFGF or FGF-2.
Stimulates proliferation of [[Fibroblast|fibroblasts]] (cells that make [[Connective Tissue]]) and endothelial cells.
Involved in wound healing, angiogenesis and development.

## PDGF (Platelet-Derived Growth Factor)
Found in high dose in blood platelets.
Strong **chemoattractant** and **mitogen** (stimulates proliferation) for fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells and other mesenchymal cells.
Key role in wound healing by bringing repair cells to injury site
