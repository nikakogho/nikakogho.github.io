How a [[Solution]] affects cell's water content
![Pasted_image_20230223223152.png](pasted_image_20230223223152.png)

* Hypertonic - moves water outside (cell shrinks)
* Hypotonic - inside (cell expands)
* Isotonic - balance, no net flow

Needs solvent concentration gradient + solvent must be unable to move through membrane

* Hypertonic - cell dries up, changes shape
* Isotonic - balanced
* Hypotonic - cell fills up with water, may eventually explode

Isotonic condition is mostly best but plants prefer hypotonic
