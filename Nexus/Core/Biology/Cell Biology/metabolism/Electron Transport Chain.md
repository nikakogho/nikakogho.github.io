0. Electrons arrive via carrier from earlier steps like [[Krebs Cycle]] or [[Photosynthesis]]
1. Through [[Glucose]] breakdown reactions the electrons are freed
2. Free electrons interact with proteins bound to inner membrane and cause a release of free protons (H<sup>+</sup>)
3. Free protons hit [[ATP]] synthase and produce ATP
