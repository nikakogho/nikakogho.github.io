Organelle in plant cells responsible for [[Photosynthesis|photosynthesis]].
Produces [[ATP]], [[NADPH]] and O<sub>2</sub>

![chloroplast.png](chloroplast.png)

Disk-like **thylakoids** are arranged in columns (each called a granum).
Fluid inside chloroplast is **stroma**.

## Thylakoid

Surrounded by **thylakoid membrane**, inside is **thylakoid space** (*lumen*)

### Thylakoid Membrane

Contains [[Chlorophyll]] for absorbing light, and also breaks down water into

* free protons that go inside lumen
* free electrons used in [[Electron Transport Chain]]
* leftover oxygen that gets removed

Contains many proteins embedded in it such as [[ATP]] synthase and **photosystems** I and II

#### Photosystems

Contain chlorophyll, use light, where photosynthesis really happens.

### Lumen

Accumulates protons (H<sup>+</sup>) to create proton gradient needed for ATP synthase (embedded in thylakoid membrane) to turn ADP into ATP
