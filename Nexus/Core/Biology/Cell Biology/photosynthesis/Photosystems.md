Part of **thylakoid membrane** in [[Chloroplast]].
Contain [[Chlorophyll]], use light, where [[Photosynthesis|photosynthesis]] really happens.

Has many pigment molecules for absorbing light (they absorb different wavelength to get more coverage) such as

* Chlorophyll (300-400 in each photosystem)
  * Chlorophyll a - violet-blue (430 nm) and red (662 nm) light
  * Chlorophyll b - blue (453 nm) and orange-red (642 nm) light
* Carotenoids - few, absorb blue-green and violet (400-500 nm). Also absorb excess light and dissipate as heat to protect from damage (**protoprotection**)
* Phycobilins (in cyanobacteria and red algae, not in plants)
  * Phycoerithrin - green-yellow, 565 nm
  * Phycocyanin - orange-red, 620 nm
  * Allophycocyanin - red, 650 nm

Has

* **Antenna Complex** where pigments get light and relay gained energy to pigments closer to center
* **Reaction Center** where a special pair of chlorophyll (P700 for Photosystem I and P680 for Photosystem II) excite and release an electron (all others were just relaying energy toward here)

## Steps

0. Photosystem II receives light, exciting electrons to higher energy state
1. Photosystem II passes electrons to electron accepter
2. **Water Splitting** - to replace these lost electrons, water is broken down into oxygen (released as gas), free protons (build up in lumen), and free electrons (which the photosystem keeps)
3. Released electrons pass through electron transport chain (ETC) to give energy to the pump bringing protons from stroma (outside) to lumen (inside) to make proton gradient
4. Photosystem I receives light and re-excites the depleted electrons received after electron transport chain
5. Photosystem I releases these electrons to turn NADP+ into NADPH
6. **Chemiosmosis** - proton gradient means free protons leave lumen through ATP synthase, turning ADP into ATP in process

This is energetically favorable due to energy received in the special pairs P680 and P700 from light

## Cyclic Photophosphorilation

Previous process was non-cyclic, as electrons were spent to turn NADP<sup>+</sup> to NADPH.
In cyclic version we don’t do that and instead recycle electrons so we don’t need Photosystem II in this case
![cyclic_photophosphorylation.jpeg](cyclic_photophosphorylation.jpeg)
This is triggered in case of intense energy demand due to trouble when NADPH need can be temporarily neglected
