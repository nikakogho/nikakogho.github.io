Process in [[Plants]] and [[Algae]] for turning sunlight into energy.

In plants this is mostly in cells in the middle layers of leaf called **mesophyll**: small pores called **stomata** are on leaf surface and they let CO<sub>2</sub> in and O<sub>2</sub> out. Mesophyll has [[Chloroplast|chloroplasts]] contain [[Photosystems]] with [[Chlorophyll]] where it all happens.

Has a light-dependent first stage and a light-independent second stage (Calvin cycle)

## Light-Dependent Reactions

In thylakoid membranes of chloroplast in chlorophyll.

### Steps

0. Chlorophyll absorbs light, excites electrons to higher energy level
1. Water splitting (**photolysis**) - to replace the lost electrons, water is split into H<sup>+</sup>, O<sub>2</sub> and free electrons
2. High energy electrons move through [[Electron Transport Chain]] to make [[ATP]] and [[NADPH]]

### Products

* ATP
* NADPH
* O<sub>2</sub>

## Calvin Cycle

AKA *dark reaction*

Light-independent second stage in stroma where ATP and NADPH that we got from first stage is used to turn CO<sub>2</sub> into G3P and then G3P into [[Sugar|sugars]]
