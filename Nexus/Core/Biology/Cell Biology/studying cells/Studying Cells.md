Often used techniques are
- [[Microscopes]]
- [[Polymerase Chain Reaction]]
- Bleaching of different kinds such as
	- [[Nissl Stain]]
	- [[Golgi Stain]]

What to lookout for:
- [[Photobleaching]] (damage from too much light)
- Rapturing cells from too much mechanical stress
- Electron microscope can damage living cells through radiation or overheating (dehydration)
	- Somewhat fixed by cryo-electron microscopy
