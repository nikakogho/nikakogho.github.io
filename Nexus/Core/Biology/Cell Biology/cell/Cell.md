Smallest unit of [[Life|life]].

Surrounded by plasma membrane that is hydrophobic on outside and hydrophilic on inside.

Outside is [[Extracellular Matrix]].

Has [[DNA]] inside, in a nucleus for [[Eukaryotes]] or just floating around for [[Prokaryotes]].

Content is in <b>cytoplasm</b>, mostly liquid named <b>cytosol</b> fills it.
Inside cytoplasm we find parts that make the cell work.

## Parts:
* [[Cell Membrane]]
* [[Cell Nucleus]]
* [[Ribosome|Ribosomes]]
* [[Mitochondria]]
* [[Chloroplast]]
* [[Golgi apparatus]]
* [[Endoplasmic Reticulum]]
* [[Centrosome]]
* [[Peroxisome]]
* [[Cytoskeleton]]
* [[Endomembrane System]]

## [[Metabolism|Cell Metabolism]]
Follows the process of [[Cell Cycle|cell cycle]].
Inserts external materials and exerts them out through processes of [[Endocytosis and Exocytosis]].

Relies on energy from mitochondria for [[Cellular Respiration]] and in case of plants/algae on chloroplast for [[Photosynthesis]].

## Differentiation
Cells start as totipotent [[Stem Cells|stem cells]] in [[Zygote]] and differentiate all the way to specialized blood, bone, muscle, skin or neuron cells.

## Death
There are 2 ways cells can die:
1. Apoptosis - when cell is no longer needed, it shuts down
2. Necrosis - cell is damaged beyond repair and dies, usually results in death of multiple cells

## Cell-To-Cell Adhesion
Mediated by proteins, mostly [[Cadherin|cadherins]]
