Phospholipid bilayer with hydrophilic heads and hydrophobic tails. Embedded in it are many [[Protein|proteins]] like [[Ion channel|ion channels]], carriers and others for allowing some molecules to pass in and out of the cell

## Phospholipid Bilayer

Prevents polar and charged molecules from entering/leaving

## [[Cell Membrane Proteins]]

To make the membrane semi-permeable with

* Facilitated diffusion (molecules passing naturally through channels)
* Secondary Active Transport (molecules hitching a ride with a molecule naturally flowing through its concentration gradient)
* Primary Active Transport - using [[ATP]] to pump molecules in or out
