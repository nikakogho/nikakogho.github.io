Make the [[Cell Membrane]] semi-permeable (some molecules can pass through)

## Facilitated Diffusion

Channel in which specific molecules like Na<sup>+</sup> or other can pass. Can be always open or can be gated based on cell voltage or based on binding to some molecule

## Secondary Active Transport

Since some molecules naturally flow on a concentration gradient, their energy can be used to either pass a molecule along with them or to exchange them

* Symporter (cotransporter) - a molecule hitches a ride along with another molecule going through natural transport
* Antiporter (exchanger) - one enters naturally while other leaves or one leaves while other enters

## Primary Active Transport

Uses [[ATP]] to pump molecules in or out, like the [[Ion pump]]
