AKA sugar residues

[[Sugar]] molecules covalently linked to [[Protein|proteins]], [[Lipids|lipids]] or nucleic acids.

In proteins, attached to amino acid to form *glycoprotein*, marker to identify and target locations in cell. Or can help with protein stability and folding.

In lipids, *glycolipids* on surface of cell membranes, as receptors or protection from environment.
Can also help be identified by other cells for immune function and cell-to-cell communication.

In nucleic acids, affect [[Gene|gene]] influence and [[RNA]] stability.
