Primary, Secondary, Tertiary, Quaternary structures of a [[Protein|protein]].
Primary chain of [[Amino acids|amino acids]] becomes the quaternary structure through process called protein folding. This is mostly self-directed but also helped by [[Chaperone Proteins|chaperone proteins]].

Predicting how a given amino acid chain folds was a big problem recently solved by [[AlphaFold]] from [[DeepMind]], for which they got a Nobel prize.

Protein **denatures** when its quaternary structure dissolves, this can happen from radiation, temperature above 40 degrees Celsius or other problems.
Once environment is good, protein will **renaturate** (refold).

## Primary

Chain of amino acids

## Secondary

Alfa helixes and beta sheets

## Tertiary

Alfa helixes and beta sheets + loops and irregular shapes, making overall shape
Overall 3D shape

## Quaternary

Multiple protein chains (subunits). Aggregate of proteins
