[[Protein|Proteins]] that catalyze chemical reactions.
Involved in most [[Metabolism|metabolic]] reactions, essential for [[Life|life]].

Unique 3D structure giving it exact shape to bind to substrate.

## How they work
Enzymes bind to substrate and lower energy needed for reaction.

Each enzyme works for one or one small group of reactions.

Active site binds to substrate.
Can have multiple active sites.

- Active site - where substrate binds
- Allosteric site - where other molecules can bind to affect enzyme efficiency

Regulated by inhibitors and activators.
Inhibitors can be competitive (bind to active site) or non-competitive (bind to allosteric site).

Sometimes need help from [[Coenzymes|coenzymes]] to work.

## Role In

- [[Metabolism]]
- [[DNA Replication]]
- Catalysts in labs/factories
