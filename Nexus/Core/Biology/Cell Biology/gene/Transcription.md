Segments of [[DNA]] are used as templates to form [[RNA#messenger RNA (mRNA)|mRNA]].
Same segment of DNA can create mRNA repeatedly.

Steps:

* *Pre-mRNA* is created
* 5' cap is added in start to signal this is where it should begin
* poly-A tail (lots of Adenine) added at the end to protect mRNA from being broken down by cell
* introns (non-coding sequences) are removed

Some RNA is not translated, instead they serve as catalysts, or as regulators or structural functions.

# Reverse Transcription

RNA is used to produce DNA.
Enzyme reverse transcriptase uses RNA to make complementary DNA (cDNA).
Enzyme polymerase converts cDNA into double-stranded DNA

[[Viruses|Retroviruses]] use reverse transcription to copy viral genomes.

Sometimes transcription fails to stop at terminate sign.
