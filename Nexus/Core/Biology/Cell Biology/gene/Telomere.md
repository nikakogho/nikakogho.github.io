Piece of [[DNA]] at the ends of a [[Chromosome]] that acts as a protective cap to protect the internal DNA.

Shortens over time and once fully gone then the DNA starts taking damage, which causes aging.
Can be regenerated by [[Enzymes|enzyme]] *telomerase*.

## Structure

Thousands of repeats of TTAGGG.
Non-coding.
Single-stranded overhang.
