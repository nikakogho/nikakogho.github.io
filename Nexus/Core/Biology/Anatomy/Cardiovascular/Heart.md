Main engine of the body to circulate [[Blood]] ([[Arteries]] and [[Veins]]).
Biggest [[Muscle]] in the body.
Part of [[Cardiovascular System]].

## Anatomy

![heart_cross_section.jpeg](heart_cross_section.jpeg)

### Left and Right Atria

Reservoirs, keep blood and when contracting push it to ventricles.

* Right receives deoxygenated blood
* Left receives oxygenated blood

### Left and Right Ventricles

Right

* Thinner wall
* Pumps deoxygenated blood to [[Lung|lungs]] to oxygenate it

Left

* Thicker wall to make higher pressure
* Pumps oxygen-rich blood to body through aorta

### Aorta

Biggest artery. Starts in left ventricle and extends to abdomen.
Primary conduit of blood in body.

### Superior Vena Cava

Carries deoxygenated blood from upper body (head, neck, arms, chest) and empties into right atrium

### Inferior Vena Cava

Takes deoxygenated blood from lower body and into right atrium

### Coronary Arteries

Arteries from aorta to heart

### Cardiac Veins

Take deoxygenated blood from heart to right atrium

### Heart Valves

1. Tricuspid - between right atrium and right ventricle
2. Pulmonary - between right ventricle and pulmonary artery
3. Mitral - between left atrium and left ventricle
4. Aortic - between left ventricle and aorta

### Septum

Separates left and right areas of heart to keep oxygenated and deoxygenated blood separate

### Heart Wall

3 layers:

1. Epicardium - outer protective
2. Myocardium - thick, muscular middle for pumping
3. Endocardium - thin inner lining to ensure blood doesnâ€™t stick to heart

## Function Parameters

* Cardiac Output (CO): 4.9 Liters per minute, calculated as Stroke Volume (SV) times Heart Rate (HR, 70 bpm)
* Cardiac Index (CI): CO normalized to Body Surface Area (BSA) - typically 2.6-4.2 L/min/m<sup>2</sup>
* Ejection Fraction (EF): % of blood ejected from left ventricle on each contraction. Low means heart failure or weakened heart
* Heart Rate (HR): average 75 bpm
* Power: 0.8-1.3 W, calculated as pressure \* flow
* Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP): average pressure in arteries in one cycle flow
* Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP):
