Homogenous mixture of 2+ substances. Source is solvent, added is solute.

## Osmosis

![cell_solution_hypo_hyper_iso.png](cell_solution_hypo_hyper_iso.png)

* Hypotonic - outside is less concentrated so water moves inside and cell (or other system) gets bloated
* Hypertonic - outside is more concentrated, water leaves, cell shrinks
* Isotonic - balance, no net flow

Water moves opposite to solventâ€™s concentration gradient, probably because solvent molecules interrupt water movement so side that has more solvent moves less water.

**Osmolarity** = how much solvent in solution.
Warer generally moves to higher osmolarity

Comparing 2 solutions:

* Hyperosmotic - more osmolarity
* Hypopsmotic - less
* Isoosmotic - equal

[[Tonicity]]
