Cations - Na<sup>+</sup> cation of sodium - Sodium <b>Ion</b> 
Anions - Cl<sup>-</sup> anion of chlorine - Chlor<b>ide</b>

**Ionic Compounds** - cation first, anion next
NaCl - Sodium Chloride
H2S - Hydrogen Sulfide

Fe<sup>2+</i> = Iron (II)

## Naming acids and their anions
Amount of Oxygen determines how acids and anions are named in this way:
| Number of Oxygen | Acid prefix/suffix | Acid example | Anion prefix/suffix | Anion Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| -IC + 1 | PER- / -IC | Perchloric Acid (HClO4) | PER- / -ATE | Perchlorate (ClO4) |
| -IC Acid | -IC | Chloric Acid (HClO3) | -ATE | Chlorate (ClO3) |
| -IC - 1 | -OUS | Chlorous Acid (HClO2) | - ITE | Chlorite (ClO2) |
| -IC - 2 | HYPO- / -OUS | Hypochlorous Acid (HClO) | HYPO- / -ITE | Hypochlorite (ClO) | 
| 0 | HYDRO- / -IC | Hydrochloric Acid (HCl) | -IDE | Chloride (Cl) |
