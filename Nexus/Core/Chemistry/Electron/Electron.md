Particle with negative charge.

Exist in orbitals, which exist in shells.

Electrons can be made by excitation of [[Electron field|electron field]], a wave.

Is always located somewhere within the function of the wave.
Waves are stronger in some areas meaning electron is more likely to be there.

## Shells
1. First shell - 2 electrons
	1. S-orbital - 2 electrons
2. Second shell - 8 electrons
	1. S-orbital - 2 electrons
	2. P-orbital - 2 electrons arranged in 3 possible ways (2px, 2py, 2pz)

Energy needed to remove electron from shell is [[Ion|ionization]] energy.
