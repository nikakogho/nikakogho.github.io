**Nexus** is my *second brain* — a living knowledge lattice built to:

1. **Accelerate personal gnosis & transcendence**  
   *Give any motivated individual the cutting-edge understanding needed to extend lifespan, amplify cognition, and pierce the deeper mysteries of mind and universe.*

2. **Push humanity toward a super-human utopia**  
   *Chart the engineering paths to post-scarcity resources, interstellar civilization, artificial super-intelligence, and qualitative augmentation of consciousness.*

If those ambitions excite you, dive in and contribute.

## 🚀 Guiding questions that shape every note

* **Immortality** — What are the cellular, genetic, or digital routes to indefinite life?  
* **Post-scarcity** — Which technologies unlock limitless energy, matter, or computation?  
* **Cosmic expansion** — How do we become a multi-world species and harness stellar resources?  
* **Super-intelligence** — How do we build ASI safely and augment human cognition qualitatively?  
* **Consciousness & the “inner frontier”** — Can neuroscience decode qualia, astral phenomena, or soul-like substrates?  
* **Integrated pathways** — How do breakthroughs in one domain (e.g., nanotech) accelerate others (e.g., biotech)?

Every Core principle and Horizon experiment is linked so you can trace answers along the graph.
