A state a person can be put in to "pause" all metabolism, all thinking, everything, by cryonics.
We can "freeze" (more precisely vitrify) a person to then unfreeze at a later point in time.
We can do full body or just the brain.
Freezing tech exists, unfreezing does not yet.

This is one way to get a second chance at life, a way to preserve yourself in time for [[Immortality]].

Total around 650 people in cryostasis currently.
Most are properly preserved, the incidents that "ruin" the bodies (make them unrevivable due to information loss from decay or thawing) are <10% and are individual scandals from early era mostly of 1970s

Main organizations:
- USA
	- [[Alcor]] (main player) - 252 cryopreserved people
	- [[Cryonics Institute]] - 250 in Michigan
- Russia
	- [[KrioRus]] - 106 people preserved. Recently had a scandal about mishandling of bodies
- Europe
	- [[Tomorrow.bio]] - 20 preserved. Office in Berlin, preservation in Switzerland
- China
	- [[Yinfeng]] - 19 preserved as of Dec 2023
- Australia
	- [[Southern Cryonics]] - at least 2 preserved

Possible revival methods:
- Scan the brain and [[Uploaded Intelligence|upload]]
- Use some advanced future [[Tissue Engineering|tissue engineering]] to fix the damaged body while unfreezing
- Unfreeze just the brain and put it in a new robot body
- Unfreeze just the brain and engineer a new biological body for it

[[Robert Freitas]] wrote a book "Cryostasis Revival" on what can be done and how.

First person to ever get cryopreserved was James Bedford in 1967.
His body is very damaged but still held in Alcor.

## Full Body Cryostasis
Harder and more expensive, but better if you want to restore with full body instead of mind upload.
Alcor sets its price at $220k

### Steps
0. Patient's heart stops and is declared dead
1. Blood replaced with cryoprotectant fluid
2. Deep cryostasis

## Neuro-Only Cryostasis
Cheaper, easier, only thing needed in case of mind upload.
Alcor sets its price at $80k

### Steps
0. Patient's heart stops and is declared dead
1. Blood replaced with cryoprotectant fluid
2. Brain is cooled to 0-10 degrees C
3. **Neuroseparation** (separating brain from skin muscle bone etc) happens surgically carefully
4. Deep cryostasis

## Cryonics Eras
### Proto-Cryonics (1966-1975)
- Direct freezing, no cryoprotectant
- Long [[Ischemia|ischemia]]
- Massive loss of structure and so information due to ice crystals formation
- Sometimes total loss from thawing

How revival methods can do on them:
- Biological unfreezing - no ❌
- Mind uploading - maybe sometimes for the few lucky patients who retained most synaptic structure ⚠️
- Hybrid repair - most likely no ❌

### Early Organized Cryonics (1970s-1980s)
- Stable LN<sub>2</sub> storage
- Cryoprotectants to avoid ice crystals
- Alcor founded in 1972
- CI founded in 1976

- Ice formation still happened but less
- Poor perfusion (oxygen delivery from blood) compared to what is needed
- Large-scale connectome mostly preserved, but synapses possibly damaged

Revival methods on these patients:
- Biological unfreezing - still no ❌
- Mind upload - probably yes ✅
- Hybrid repair - unlikely but maybe ⚠️

### Transitional / Pre-Vitrification (1980s - 1995)
- Better cryoprotectants
- Better perfusion
- Shorter ischemia mostly
- Still not vitrification

- Ice damage still happens but less

Revival methods:
- Biological unfreezing - still no ❌
- Mind upload - most likely yes ✅
- Hybrid repair - plausible ⚠️

### Early Vitrification (1995-2010)
- Vitrification protocols
- Ice mostly eliminated
- Much better structural preservation

- Cryoprotectants have toxicity
- Some risk of fracture

- Neural architecture survives in detail
- Possibly molecular markers like dendritic spine shape survive

[[FM-2030]] was the first person to be vitrified, neuro-only.

Revival methods:
- Biological unfreezing with serious repair - plausible ⚠️
- Mind upload - will work ✅
- Hybrid repair - likely will work ✅

### Modern Vitrification (2010-Present)
- Advanced solutions like [[M22 (Cryonics)|M22]]
- Much better perfusion control
- Faster response from legal death to cryostasis
- Better monitoring

- Still no mammal has been revived as of 2026

- Possibly enough survives to unfreeze with full identity intact

Revival methods:
- Biological unfreezing with serious repair - possible ⚠️✅
- Mind upload - certain ✅
- Hybrid repair - certain ✅

| Era           | Unfreeze & revive | Upload | Hybrid repair |
| ------------- | ----------------- | ------ | ------------- |
| 1960s–70s     | ❌                 | ⚠️     | ❌             |
| Late 70s–80s  | ❌                 | ✅      | ⚠️            |
| Late 80s–1995 | ❌                 | ✅      | ⚠️            |
| 1995–2010     | ⚠️                | ✅      | ✅             |
| 2010s+        | ⚠️✅               | ✅      | ✅             |
