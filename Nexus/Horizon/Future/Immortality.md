Mostly considered through 3 ways:
- Biological way of reverse aging and curing all disease
	- [[IsomorphicLabs]] by [[Demis Hassabis]] is openly going for the goal of solving all disease
- [[Nanotechnology]] way of implanting medical nanorobots as an artificial layer of [[Immune System]] to make us able to quickly heal from any damage or disease
- [[Uploaded Intelligence|Mind Upload]] as a type of digital immortality
- [[Cryostasis]] to freeze now and unfreeze when your medical problem is solved

I personally only support ways that preserve continuity so I'm in favor of biotech and nanotech ways but weary of mind upload, but open to it if we can prove that consciousness will remain intact.
I suppose for that we must first solve the [[Hard Problem Of Consciousness]].

## [[Longevity Escape Velocity]]
Concept that each year the average lifespan of people keeps increasing at an accelerated pace because of advances in tech and medicine, and that eventually we will get to a point where people who take care of their health will be getting back more than a year of their youth per year, effectively stopping and then reversing aging.

Should follow [[Bryan Johnson]]’s Blueprint for this

## Information Theory Of Aging
Explained by [[David Sinclair]] in his book Lifespan (2019) that information loss of [[Epigenome|epigenome]] is the true cause of aging. [[Information Theory]] is relevant here

## Hallmarks of Aging
Telomere shortening and such. Probably symptoms, with information loss being root cause.
Proposed originally in 2013 by López-Otín in a [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23746838/) in journal *Cell*

### Original 9 Hallmarks
1. Genomic instability - DNA damage
2. [[Telomere]] shortening
3. Epigenetic changes
4. Loss of [[Proteostasis|proteostasis]] - cell can't maintain [[Protein|protein]] balance and integrity
5. Messed up nutrient-sensing ability ruins [[Metabolism|metabolism]]
6. [[Mitochondria]] dysfunction
7. [[Cellular Senescence]] (zombie cells) - cells get old and can't divide anymore but are still active and cause inflammation
8. Decline in number and strength of [[Stem Cells]]
9. Ruined signaling between cells
### 2023+ Hallmarks
10. Disabled Macroautophagy - decline in cellular recycling process of [[Autophagy]]
11. Chronic inflammation - low grade constant inflammation
12. Dysbiosis - imbalance in gut microbiome

## Common Issues
### If we all become immortal, what about finiteness of room and resources and overpopulation?
See [[Radical Abundance]] that is likely to emerge around the same time as immortality

### What meaning will life have once we no longer fear death?
I think this sentence is a coping mechanism lie and is not an actual problem, just something we say to help with grief of lost loved ones

### What happens to progress if people in power never die?
Yes this is a problem but AGI is coming, new space colonies are about to start popping up, there will likely be new places not ruled by anyone and new uncharted territories of how to govern. AI will probably have a high role in government as well.
Personally I think some kind of a decentralized setup will be needed across all of humanity.
DAOs and smart contracts and such on a huge scale
