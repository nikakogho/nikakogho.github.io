Idea that advancements in [[AI]], [[Robotics]], [[Bioengineering]], [[Space Mining]], [[Nanotechnology]] and [[Neurotech]] will give us a post-scarcity world where any individual will have more of everything than the billionaires of today do.

We will transcend hunger, disease, aging, [[Immortality|death]], limits of a human body, and gain new and strange senses, strengths, intelligence, perception, shapeshifting ability, start colonizing the space and do many other things we cannot even imagine yet

[[Eric Drexler]] discusses this in his book "Radical Abundance" (2013)

We can estimate that simply by mining the [[Asteroid Belt]] between Mars and Jupiter we can get enough resources to easily support a civilization of over 200 trillion humans
