Electron [[Microscopes|microscope]], when hitting the sample, scatters some x rays we can use determine what sample is made of

## How
Electron hitting sample will knock some electrons out, so to stabilize an existing electron will jump down from higher shell and in this jump emit x ray unique by element and shell

## Limits
Some elements donâ€™t emit enough x rays to be detected this way
