Needed for [[Configuration]] for [[Navigation]] of [[Robotics|robots]]

Multiple methods to represent and plan the configuration trajectory, such as Meadow Maps, Generalized Voronoi Graphs (GVG), and grids

### Meadow Maps

Draw thick (equal to robot width) rectangular boundaries around obstacles

At most basic step we simply connect corners

Then we take their midpoints for less bumpy navigation

Alternatively (a better way in fact) we apply path relaxation to skip some steps where itâ€™s possible to turn A -> B -> C into A -> C without a collision

#### Problems

1. Computationally expensive
2. Relies on map being fully accurate and static
3. Unclear how to tell the robot is at midpoint

### Generalized Voronoi Graphs (GVGs)

We create a line (Voronoi Edge) equidistant from all obstacles. This naturally puts robot path always in middle and avoids the need to thicken the map

### Grid

We mark cells that contain obstacle as occupied

4-connected if only up-down-left-right moves,
8-connected if diagonal allowed

#### Digitization Bias

Cells that barely contain obstacle are marked as occupied, wasting space. Can be solved by using smaller cells but that means higher space and time cost

#### Quadtrees

Avoid waste of space by recursively shrinking cell size when cell not free
