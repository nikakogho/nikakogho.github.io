Technique that lets a robot take photos to construct a terrain map (relevant in [[SLAM]]) with better resolution than satellite images.

## Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT)
Take two images from different positions but have enough overlap, then SIFT algorithm will adjust into a 3D map from the **orthomosaic** (high resolution master image made from connecting many images)

## Errors
- Ghosting - object looks imposed over itself
- Misalignment of structures
- Misproportion
- Swirling blur (“Dali effect” because of Salvador Dali)
