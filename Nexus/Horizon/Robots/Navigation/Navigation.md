Can be topological (use landmarks as references of where to turn) or metric (use coordinates)

[[Configuration Space Representations For Navigation]]

 A robot often needs [[SLAM]] to navigate

## Metric Path Planning
Essentially a [[Search in Computing|search]] problem

Generally we assume a holonomic vehicle (can turn and move in any direction)

If not holonomic then we need motion planning of how to move legs and such to not crash
