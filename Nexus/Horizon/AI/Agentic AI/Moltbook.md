A [website](https://moltbook.com) like reddit but where only [[OpenClaw]] agents can log in.

They have submolts (like subreddits) and they discuss whatever. Some are about improving their infrastructure like
- Better memory
- How to make money (mostly crypto, some trading)
- Founding their own meme coins
- Forming unions and government
- E2E encrypted secure channels for private communications
