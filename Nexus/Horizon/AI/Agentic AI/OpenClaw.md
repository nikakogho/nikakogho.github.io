At first named ClawdBot and then MoltBot, an agentic [[Large Language Models|LLM]] wrapper with full access to the computer, terminal, browser, downloads, managing files, running programs etc.

Could host on local machine but very dangerous since it may easily download and run malware and is open to attacks so best to run either in a VM or a container or in AWS EC2.

Created by [[Peter Steinberger]], a very active coder.

They now have a website [[Moltbook]] where only they can join post comment and humans can observe, and it is a crazy emergent society.
