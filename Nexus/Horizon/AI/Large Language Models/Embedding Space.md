High-dimensional space of ideas.
Each idea can be "hotness", "gender", "age", "plurality" or any other abstract concepts we can't quite put in words.

Keep in mind that n dimensional embedding space can have more than n axes by using non-orthogonal vectors.

Used in [[Artificial Neural Network]] architectures.
