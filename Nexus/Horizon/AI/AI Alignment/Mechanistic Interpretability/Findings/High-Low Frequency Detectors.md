Neurons whose job it is to find a region where a high frequency (high resolution) and a low frequency (blurred) sectors meet

[[Mechanistic Interpretability]] found them in [[Convolutional Neural Network|CNNs]] and then neuroscientists realized that sounds similar to the eye focusing and checked and found similar neurons in the human [[Eye|eye]].
