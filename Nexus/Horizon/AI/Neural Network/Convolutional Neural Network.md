Type of [[Artificial Neural Network|neural network]]

Often used in [[Computer Vision]]
**Convolution** - applying a filter that uses kernel matrix on each pixel to add some mixture of its neighbors to it, useful for feature extraction

Can be used to detect curve, shape, edge, etc.

## Pooling
6x6 image can become 3x3 by applying some function upon each 2x2 section of it
Reduces image size

### Max Pooling
Select max as value

### Average Pooling
Average value of points in region
