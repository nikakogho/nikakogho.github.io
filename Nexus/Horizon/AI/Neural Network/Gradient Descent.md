## Basic version
0. Start with random weights
1. Calculate gradient based on **all** data points
2. Update weights
3. Back to step 1

## Stochastic
0. Start with random weights
1. Calculate gradient based on **1 random** data point
2. Update weights
3. Back to step 1

## Mini-Batch
0. Start with random weights
1. Calculate gradient based on **a small batch** of data points
2. Update weights
3. Back to step 1
