2 [[Artificial Neural Network|neural networks]] compete: 1 generates fake data, other tries to tell which data is real and which was AI generated

Data can be text, images, music, video, face…

Generator keeps getting better at making undetectable fakes.
Detective gets better at spotting any mistake.
They keep competing until generator makes fake data so good the detective can’t tell anymore (this is similar to the [[Turing Test Games Between LLMs]] I experimented with)

## CycleGAN

Transform existing dataset into something new, like turn a horse into a zebra or based on this music make new music or change genre of this music
