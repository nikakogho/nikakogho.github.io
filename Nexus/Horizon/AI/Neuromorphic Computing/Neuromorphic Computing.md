Code styled similar to human brain.
Quite differently from what [[Artificial Neural Network|neural networks]] typically mean today, a neuromorphic computer would have far more loops and interconnectedness, and sometimes different hardware.

Would use
- [[Spiking Neural Networks]] so that activation can be sparse
- United processing and storing chip instead of separate CPU + RAM, so would save on energy and time spent communicating between CPU and RAM

## Notable Projects
- [[DeepSouth]]
