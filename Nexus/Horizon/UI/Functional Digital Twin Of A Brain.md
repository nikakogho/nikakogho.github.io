A type of [[Uploaded Intelligence]] that goes by the principle of "if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it's a duck"

We build an [[AI]] model that learns to emulate exact activation behavior of a set of real [[Neuron|neurons]]. We say such a mind is "substrate-independent" and as long as they do the same computation we don't care if they run on neurons or simulated neurons or just a Multi Layer [[Perceptron]] or whatever.

When studying the behavior of a functional digital twin, [[Neuroscience]] and [[Mechanistic Interpretability]] become the same thing.
