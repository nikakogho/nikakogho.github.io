Also known as mind upload, digital twin, or Whole Brain Emulation

Can be a literal copy of a person's mind or a replica of a living brain in general

Some people consider this a way to get digital [[Immortality|immortality]]

Different levels:
- [[Functional Digital Twin Of A Brain]]
- Connectome Level Simulation
- Cellular Level Simulation
- Atomic Level Simulation
- Quantum Level Simulation

Show Pantheon does Connectome level simulation.

When uploading a mind, I think more important than level of simulation is whether the process is gradual and preserving continuity or not (the show Pantheon does not preserve continuity so I would argue the originals all died)

[[Ray Kurzweil]] goes into some detail about this is his book "The Singularity Is Nearer"

A company [[Nectome]] is attempting this and has [[Sam Altman]] in waitlist
