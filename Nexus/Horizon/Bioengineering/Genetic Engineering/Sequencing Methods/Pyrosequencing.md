Works for mostly 500 bp
Relatively quick at 7-12 hours

## Steps
0. We have single stranded DNA and DNA polymerase
1. We loop through AGCT and try to add each
2. When added successfully, pyrophosphate (PPi) is released
3. ATP Sulfurylase converts pyrophosphate to ATP
4. Luciferase uses that ATP to emit light
5. We catch the light and determine which nucleotide was added (if it was same nucleotide, we just get a higher intensity. If too many same nucleotides like AAAAAA in order then it gets hard to tell exact amount)
6. Repeat until done
