Famous type of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS)
Fast and high-throughput
Developed by Illumina Inc

**Sequencing By Synthesis (SBS)** - nucleotides added to growing strand, each addition detected in real-time

High accuracy, scalability and cost-effectiveness

## Steps
1. Sample prepared:
	1. **Fragmentation** - sample split into 200-500 bp long fragments
	2. **Adaptor Ligation** - short DNA sequences called *adaptors* are added to each end of each fragment
	3. **Library Preparation** - sequencing library, a collection of adaptor-ligated fragments prepared
2. Cluster Generation (Bridge Amplification)
	1. **Flow Cell Loading** -
