Original way of [[Genome Sequencing]]

In 1977 Frederick Sanger came up with the technique.
Typically on 1 kb
Slow compared to modern methods
Still in use
Costs ~ $3 per 1 kb

## Steps

0. We take a template single stranded DNA (possibly many copies for parallel runs) and DNA polymerase
1. We have dNTP that can attach as other side and continue the chain and small amount of ddNTPs that attach and end the chain by not having 3' end on which others would attach
2. the ddNTPs have a fluorescent dye so we can tell what base pair went at that position
3. this is done many times such that the generated strand can be terminated at all of the possible locations (done on relatively small template strands)
4. **Capillary Electrophoresis** sorts fragments by size, allowing us to read each of the nucleotide values correctly
5. **Electropherogram Signal** displays colored peaks for each nucleotide in sequence. If a location was missed (highly unlikely due to vast amount of runs), it would appear on this display and we would know
