Because today's organisms all got here by [[Evolution By Natural Selection|evolution by natural selection]], many of their edits were patch-on-patch changes due to limited step sizes per generation.

As a result, many traits ended up in a local minimum kind of situation where it makes sense compared to its exact ancestor, but globally it obviously could be done better.

Many examples in this list have been attempted to be refuted by creationists or by people who want to praise evolution, I include the response to their arguments in each, essentially "sure let's grant that that's why this tradeoff was made. Here is how it could've been even better while considering your arguments".

Keeping this list in mind is important not just for arguing against intelligent design but also for seeing how we can do better in humans and in animals with [[Genetic Engineering]] and also for what principles to consider for a top-down design in [[Robotics|robots]].

## Examples

## Recurrent Laryngeal Nerve Is Too Long

The nerve takes a detour and goes brain -> chest -> loops around aorta -> larynx, instead of just going brain -> larynx. This is necessary because of current migration plan in [[Human Embryonic Development|human embryonic development]], but could be done better if there was foresight into it such that adult human (or giraffe or other animals) can more directly communicate.
This is more clearly a problem for giraffes where the axon now has to travel the entire neck down and back up.

## Blind Spot In Eye

The [[Eye|human eye]] has a blind spot because optic nerves route from the outside and block some of the place where light could shine onto a receptor.

More about this blind spot [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNCKhzaQZhI).
Cephalopods (octopuses, squids...) solve this by wiring the optic nerves behind the retina.

Arguments people have for why actually this design in mammals is good and response to each:

1. Blind spot means less info to process so the brain saves on compute and energy - if this was the goal, slightly less ganglion density would work way better than a hole in a slot where information is now lost
2. It's not that much of a loss since 2 eyes and just generally not a big loss - sure but it could be better
