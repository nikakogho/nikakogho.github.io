Enter organism to deliver gene teaching a cell to make proteins, like mail delivery
4.7 kilobases
Single stranded (sometimes self-complementary, AKA folds onto itself, making it ~2.3kb size but faster working since it won't need to duplicate after getting in host)

Low cytotoxicity (low damage to cell)

## Parts

* Capsid proteins - outer shell in icosahedral symmetry (20-sided)
  * Made of proteins
    * VP1
    * VP2
    * VP3
  * Serotypes - variations in capsids, affects which cells can be targeted
    * Examples:
      * AAV2 targets liver and central nervous system
      * AAV9 crosses blood-brain barrier and targets neurons
    * Tropism - ability to affect specific targets, like muscle tropism
* DNA
  * Backbone - just gives shape
  * Inverted Terminal Repeats (ITRs) - start and end section of code
  * Rep gene - replication and packaging
  * Cap gene - encodes capsid proteins

## Lifecycle

1. Entry - enter cell
2. Uncoating - Capsid opens and releases viral genome inside target cell's nucleus
3. Replication - with helper virus, AAV genome becomes double stranded and replicated. For therapeutic reasons, this step is usually skipped by making the genome replication-deficient
4. Gene expression - viral genome in double stranded form integrates in target cell and expresses desired gene
