A technique in [[ECM Scaffold Characterization]].

Checking
- shape
- porosity (amount, size, distribution)
- pore interconnectivity
- surface on micro/nano scale

## Methods
Following techniques give complementary data so sometimes they are used in combination to get the full idea.

### Visual Inspection and Light Microscopy
Simplest but hard to see internal structure for full 3D understanding and pore interconnectivity

### Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)
Focused beam of electrons scans surface. This interaction creates signals like secondary and backscattered electrons, which together give high-resolution image of surface topography. Sample must be conductive (coated in gold/carbon if not conductive).

High detail of surface but poor knowledge of 3D inside and sometimes coating can damage the sample

### Micro-Computer Tomography (Micro-CT)
Like medical CT scan but higher resolution. Takes X-rays of 2D slices and computer reassembles into 3D shape.

Pros:
- Gives full 3D shape and details of everything

Cons:
- resolution limited to few micrometers
- some low-density polymers with low x-ray attenuation may not give good result
- relatively slow and computationally intensive

### Mercury Intrusion Porosimetry
Checks pore size, distribution and volume by forcing mercury into pores under increasing pressure. Smaller pores need higher pressure.

Cons:
- only measures pores
- assumes cylindrical pores, sometimes wrong
- high pressure may damage scaffold
- mercury is toxic (dangerous to scientist)

### Liquid Displacement / Gas Pycnometry
Liquid - Archimedes’ principle, fill with water and see how much water was displaced.

Gas pycnometry - same but using inert gas like helium to ensure small pores are also filled.

Pro:
- gives accurate estimate of total solid volume

Con:
- doesn’t give any other data

### Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM)
Sharp tip of flexible cantilever moved across all surface, deformations giving surface data.

Gives nanoscale resolution details of surface shape and material strength but doesn’t give any data about inside and can be very slow for large surfaces.
Challenging for very soft or very rough samples.
