A technique in [[ECM Scaffold Characterization]].

To measure biodegradation rate (how fast the [[ECM Scaffold]] loses mass and mechanical strength) and to analyze biodegradation products.

## Techniques
### In Vitro Degradation Studies
Scaffold samples incubated in body-like fluid (37Â°C) for 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, etc. At each time point, samples are removed and tested to see
- mass loss
- change in compressive and tensile strength
- degradation products analyzed using [[Chromatography]] or [[pH scale|pH meters]] to measure what and how much was released in the liquid
- SEM or other [[ECM Scaffold Morphological and Structural Characterization]] techniques used to visualize how scaffold structure changed
- Molecular weight change: for polymer scaffolds, **Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC)** can measure decrease in molecular weight over time (indicates chain cleavage)
