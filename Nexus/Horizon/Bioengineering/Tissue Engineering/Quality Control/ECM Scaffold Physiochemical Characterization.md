A technique in [[ECM Scaffold Characterization]].
Finding out what chemical properties are on the [[ECM Scaffold]], especially on surface as cells will be interacting with that first.

## Techniques
### Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR)
Infrared light to identify chemical bonds in material: different bonds vibrate at different frequencies when absorbing IR light (“chemical fingerprint”)

### X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) / Electron Spectroscopy for Chemical Analysis (ESCA)
Highly surface-sensitive for finding out elemental composition and chemical state of top few nm of material surface

### Contact Angle Measurement
Angle a liquid (mostly water) droplet makes with the ECM scaffold surface.
Determines **wettability**:
- low contact angle (<90°) - hydrophilic
- high contact angle (>90°) - hydrophobic

Cell adhesion is better on hydrophilic surfaces
