Coherent - X -> Z is same sign (positive or negative) as X -> Y -> Z
Incoherent - opposite sign

Most common: coherent type 1 and incoherent type 1

Coherent 1 FFL is a [[Sign-Sensitive Delay]] element

## Biphasic response

Incoherent response can have rising and then lowering phase, called "biphasic".
Happens if X activates Z first, then Y accumulates and represses Z
