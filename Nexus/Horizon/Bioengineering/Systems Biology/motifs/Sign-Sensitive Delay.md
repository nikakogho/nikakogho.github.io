If [[Transcription Factor]] changes, there will be delay but only for one sign (turned on or turned off)

Can be used as **persistence detector** by checking if a pulse lasts longer than delay and therefore makes it, so that ON activates when pulse is longer than delay but OFF activates right away (or vice versa).
Can help differentiate random noise from true signal

AND gate has delay at ON and no delay at OFF
OR gate has delay at OFF and no delay at ON
