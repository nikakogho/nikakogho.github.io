Led mostly by [[David Sinclair]] and his [[Information Theory of Aging]]

Core part of the idea of [[Immortality]]

## Information Theory Of Aging
Explained by [[David Sinclair]] in his book Lifespan (2019) that information loss of [[Epigenome|epigenome]] is the true cause of aging. [[Information Theory]] is relevant here

### [[Sirtuins]]
"Survival circuits" that make sure when DNA is damaged the cell stops dividing, goes fixes the damage and only then continues. Sinclair thinks sirtuins can reverse the aging process by being triggered, and that they can be triggered by:
- Hunger - intermittent fasting or caloric restriction
- Uncomfortable temperature - sauna or walk in the snow
- HIIT exercise or running

## Hallmarks of Aging
Causes of aging that, if addressed, can slow down or even reverse aging.
All likely stemming from the root cause of epigenetic information loss.
Proposed originally in 2013 by López-Otín in a [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23746838/) in journal *Cell*

### Original 9 Hallmarks
1. Genomic instability - DNA damage
2. [[Telomere]] shortening
3. Epigenetic changes
4. Loss of [[Proteostasis|proteostasis]] - cell can't maintain [[Protein|protein]] balance and integrity
5. Messed up nutrient-sensing ability ruins [[Metabolism|metabolism]]
6. [[Mitochondria]] dysfunction
7. [[Cellular Senescence]] (zombie cells) - cells get old and can't divide anymore but are still active and cause inflammation
8. Decline in number and strength of [[Stem Cells]]
9. Ruined signaling between cells

### 2023+ Hallmarks
10. Disabled Macroautophagy - decline in cellular recycling process of [[Autophagy]]
11. Chronic inflammation - low grade constant inflammation
12. Dysbiosis - imbalance in gut microbiome

### [[Retrotransposons]]
Sinclair thinks these "jumping genes" also contribute to aging and that in older cells the sirtuins can't properly stop them anymore and that's why we get inflammations in old age, so fighting them could slow aging

## [[Yamanaka Factors]]
Way to de-differentiate an adult cell back into a [[Stem Cells|stem cell]].
Currently fully reprograms the adult cell, which is too far.
Sinclair and his team are working on partial reprogramming.
This restores the lost epigenetic information so should be enough for de-aging if information theory of aging is correct.

## [[Senolytics]]
Drugs to kill [[Cellular Senescence|senescent]] cells ("old age" cells that don't divide anymore and are basically zombies and can harm neighbors and even turn neighbors into tumors)
