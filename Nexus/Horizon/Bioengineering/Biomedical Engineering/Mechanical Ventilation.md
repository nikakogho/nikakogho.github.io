For people with breathing problems.

Often becomes a problem if ventilator has too much pressure (explodes lungs) or too little pressure (sucks air out, suffocates person).

Ways to make it safe:
- [[Neurally Adjusted Ventilatory Assist (NAVA)]] - invasive, put [[Electromyography (EMG)|EMG]] in body with catheter from mouth or nose
- With sEMG from outside to do it non-invasively
