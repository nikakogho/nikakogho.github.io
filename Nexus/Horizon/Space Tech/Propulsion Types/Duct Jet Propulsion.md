Fuel inside rocket reacts with air in atmosphere for thrust.
Higher [[Specific Impulse]] makes them a better choice in atmosphere
Thrust-to-weight ratio typically 5:1 or 7:1, as opposed to 75:1 for rocket
Consumes less fuel than rocket
Limited altitude
Higher altitude -> lower thrust
More speed -> more thrust
Flight speed always less than exhaust velocity

## Turbojet

Most common
Thrust-to-weight ratio typically 5:1

## Turbofan

TODO

## Ramjet

Thrust-to-weight ratio typically 7:1
For supersonic flights above Mach 2

## Pulsejet

Propulsion happens in pulses
Nazi Germany's V1 rocket used it
