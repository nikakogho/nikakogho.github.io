Cameras used on [[Satellite]]

Often used for [[Earth Imaging]]

Common to have a multi-spectral camera, which can even work in a [[CubeSat]], as described [here](https://simera-sense.com/news/multispectral-cubesat-imagers-understanding-the-benefits-and-limitations/)

- Multi-spectral: 3 to 10 spectral bands
- Hyperspectral: hundrens of narrow spectral bands

## Light Ranges
- VNIR (Visible and Near InfraRed) - 400nm to 1000nm, used for [[Vegetation Indices]] and edge detection of water lines, since both plants reflect NIR and water absorbs it
- Short-Wave InfraRed Sensors (SWIR) - 1000nm to 2500nm, sensitive to moisture in vegetation and soil, so good for drought detection among other things like telling snow vs cloud, find crop residues, map burn scars together with VNIR
- Long-Wave InfraRed (LWIR) (Thermal InfraRed) - 8-14 micrometers range, measure thermal radiation, so good for fires and volcanoes

## For CubeSat
- [Dragonfly](https://dragonflyaerospace.com/products/)
- [MAPIR Survey3W RGN](https://www.mapir.camera/en-gb/products/survey3w-camera-red-green-nir-rgn-ndvi) - as cheap as $400 but we must adjust it to space (heat, cold, radiation)
- Simera Sense [MultiScape100](https://simera-sense.com/products/multiscape100/)
