Launched in 1990
Still in operation

547 km above Earth in Low Earth Orbit

Orbits Earth in 96-97 minutes

Done by [[NASA]] and [[ESA]]

Covers UV (0.1-0.4 microns), visible light (0.4-0.7 microns) and near-infrared light (NIR) (0.7-2.5 microns)

Solar arrays give it 2.8 kW power

## Goals

Studies formation of galaxies and stars, exoplanets, expansion of universe with dark energy, composition and atmosphere of exoplanets, nebulae, and gets high resolution images

## Accomplishments

* Help refine universe’s expansion rate
* By observing supernova it helped discover dark energy
* Captured unique galactic history
* **Hubble Deep Field (HDF)** and **Ultra Deep Field (HUDF)** revealed thousands of galaxies
* Provided direct evidence for supermassive black holes at galaxy centers
* Imaged atmospheric dynamics of Jupiter and Saturn
* Collisions like comet **Shoemaker-Levy9** hitting Jupiter

## Design

### Primary Mirror

* Width 2.4 meters (less than [[The James Webb Telescope]]’s 6.5 meters)
* Precision-ground for light focus and collecting
* Had initial defect that was fixed by **COSTAR instrument** in 1993

### Secondary Mirror

Reflects focused light of primary mirror into instruments

### Instruments

Have been added over time

* Wide Field and Planetary Camera (WFPC2/WFC3) - high resolution images in UV and visible light
* Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) - for **Deep Field Imaging**
* Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) - faint UV light from distant stars and galaxies
* Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) - combines imaging and spectroscopy

### Comms

Transmits data with NASA’s **Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS)**

## Deep Field Imaging

Observing empty area of sky long enough to detect faint objects like galaxies
