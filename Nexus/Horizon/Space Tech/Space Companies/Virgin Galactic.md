First [[Space Tourism]] company founded in 2004 by [[Richard Branson]].

## Unique Launch System

First "stage" is that the rocket is carried up 15km by VMS Eve plane

Then the single stage single engine rocket lights up, goes up (suborbital) and comes back and glides down on the runway

## Feathered Re-Entry

Uses big wings to glide back down to runway on re-entry (possible because due to being suborbital the rocket can optimize for atmospheric flight and gliding, for instance by using wings and such that would not scale well to orbit)
