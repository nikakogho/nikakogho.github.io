## Open-loop (removal)
CO<sub>2</sub> scrubbers
Lithium hydroxide (LiOH)

## Closed-loop (recycling)
- Multiple use metal oxide (Metox) absorbers
- [[Sabatier Reactor]]
- Rapid cycling amine (RMA) - by adsorption/desorption
    - Adsorption - Amine binds to CO<sub>2</sub>
    - “scrubbed” air returns to cabin
    - saturated bed is heated or exposed to vacuum
    - desorption - CO<sub>2</sub> removed
    - CO<sub>2</sub> goes to spave or Sabatier Reactor
    - alternates between multiple sorbent beds so that while one adsorbes another desorbes non-stop
