Water pipes flow inside, gather heat, and then contact ammonia pipe flowing on outside (because ammonia won’t freeze in outer space cold), then that heat is carried to radiators on outside where the heat radiates away in space

**Cold shadow** area - side that falls into Earth’s shadow, drops to -157 celsius

Direct sunlight heats it up to 121 Celsius

Due to quick orbit of [[International Space Station]] (90 minutes around Earth), 45 minutes are in cold shadow and 45 minutes in direct sunlight

**Thermal Control System (TCS)** protects spacecraft from this
