A lot goes into orbital mechanics.

Main things to consider are Newton’s law of gravity and [[Kepler's Laws]] for orbits as ellipses.

Useful case often used on satellites is [[Circular Orbit]] as they are put on one of [[Earth Orbits]].

Going to lower orbit needs less Δv so it’s cheaper

## Launching
Must consider [[Launch Azimuth]], [[Orbital Inclination]] and [[Orbit Directions]]

## Reaching GEO
Reaching GEO is a special case where satellites are often not taken directly but instead dropped off physically in LEO on a GTO (**geostationary transfer orbit**) trajectory (perigee in LEO, apogee at GEO) and it must take care of circularizing once at apogee. Circularizing may take weeks but this way is cheaper and mostly preferred.

Additional difficulty of operating at GEO is that it falls into the outer [[Van Allen Radiation Belts|Van Allen radiation belt]]
