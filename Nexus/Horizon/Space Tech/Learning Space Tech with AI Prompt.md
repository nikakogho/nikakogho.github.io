## CubeSat Development & Operations Learning Journey: Context for Continuation

**Overall Goal:** To gain the comprehensive knowledge and skills required to lead the software and systems aspects of developing a 1U CubeSat (for Earth imaging with on-board RPi/Jetson processing, VHF/UHF comms) and its custom ground station (extending SatNOGS). The aim is to be fully prepared for mission design, subsystem development (software & relevant hardware/equations understanding), integration, testing, and operations.

**Teaching Style & Methodology:**

- **Chapter-Based Progression:** We are systematically going through a structured chapter plan covering the end-to-end CubeSat development lifecycle.
- **Socratic Dialogue:** Each concept is explored through clear explanations followed by probing questions to ensure deep understanding, encourage critical thinking, and apply knowledge directly to the user's specific CubeSat project. The user (an experienced software engineer) actively participates.
- **Practical Engineering Focus:** We emphasize the practical application of engineering principles, equations, and software development techniques relevant to small satellite design and operation.
- **Systems Thinking:** We consistently analyze how different subsystems interact and how software integrates them into a functional whole, for both the satellite and ground station.
- **Project-Specific Tasks:** Each chapter will conclude with a proposed conceptual task, design consideration, or software/algorithmic challenge directly related to the user's 1U CubeSat project.
