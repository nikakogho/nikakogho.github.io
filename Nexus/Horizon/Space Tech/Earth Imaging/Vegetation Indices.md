## Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)

NDVI = (NIR - RED) / (NIR + RED)

Often used for vegetation density and health

## Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI)

Leaf water content, indirect drought measurement:
NDWI = (NIR – SWIR)/(NIR + SWIR)

Can also be done in green band instead:
NDWI = (Green – NIR)/(Green + NIR)

## Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI)

More sensitve for high biomass and includes blue band to reduce atmospheric influence:
EVI =

## Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI)

Also modified SAVI (MSAVI)

To minimize soil brightness influence:

## Modified Triangular Vegetation Index (MTVI2)

To measure leaf chlorophyll

## Visual Atmoshpere Resistance Index (VARI)

RGB light, color correction to remove scatters and other atmospheric phenomena for measuring crop health

VARI = (Green – Red)/(Green + Red – Blue)
