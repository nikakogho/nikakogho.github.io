Measure motor neurons ([[Muscles|muscle]])

Usually uses amplifier and voltmeter

Generally non-invasive but can also stick microneedles inside muscles

## Surface EMG (sEMG)
Applied on skin surface to measure motor neuron activity inside the body like for diaphragm

## Using EMG On Diaphragm
[[Neurally Adjusted Ventilatory Assist (NAVA)]] can be used to measure breathing to adjust a [[Mechanical Ventilation]] device's pressure to optimal amount to prevent harm
