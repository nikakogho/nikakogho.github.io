## [[Neuralink]]
Invasive
Give quadriplegics fast mouse and keyboard access by mapping their motor cortex.
Eventual goal: human-AI symbiosis

### Blindsight
Neuralink's project to restore vision by directly stimulating [[Primary Visual Cortex]]

## [[Synchron]]
Semi-invasive
Also giving paralyzed people better communication by mapping motor cortex

## [[Nudge]]
Using [[Ultrasound]] to cure chronic pain, mental illness, addiction, ADHD and eventually boost memory, learning, and mood.
Aiming to make a device cheap enough for everyone to have.
CTO is [[Bliss Chapman]], former software lead of Neuralink.

## [[OpenBCI]]
