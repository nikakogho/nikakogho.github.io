## Beliefs About AI
He thinks [[Large Language Models]] are not enough for AGI as they lack inner comprehension and instead proposes "World Models", which he explains [here](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/yann-lecun_lots-of-confusion-about-what-a-world-model-activity-7165738293223931904-vdgR).
This is why he supports making [[Large Concept Models]].

He thinks AGI will come gradually and that there is no existential risk in it (unlike what Geoffrey Hinton thinks).

Sees AI as a new phase of enlightenment and as a way to enhance human capabilities. He wants AI to be designed for expanding human skills, not for deskilling.
