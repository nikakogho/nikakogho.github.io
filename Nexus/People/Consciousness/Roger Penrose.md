Defender of [[Hard Problem Of Consciousness]].
Proposes that [[Consciousness|consciousness]] is some kind of a quantum gravity phenomenon happening in [[Cytoskeleton|microtubules]] of [[Neuron|neurons]] and that human mind is beyond a [Turing Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine) in that it can do more things because of this quantum gravity access.

He believes that [GÃ¶del's incompleteness theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorem) somehow proves that human consciousness is beyond computation and that computers are fundamentally behind.

Nobel Prize in physics for discovering that [[Black Hole]] formation predicts [[General Theory Of Relativity]].
